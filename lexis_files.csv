2003-01-02,"2 men plucked from Ben Lomond",1,"OGDEN -- It was a chilly New Year's Eve for two North Ogden men, who rang in the new year while stranded atop Ben Lomond Peak. The two 18-year-old men hiked six miles to the peak Monday, intending to do some snowboarding and spend Monday and Tuesday nights on the mountainside. However, the pair became separated in Tuesday afternoon's snowstorm and quickly became disoriented, Weber County Sheriff's Lt. Jeff Malan said. Spencer Grimley called his father on his cell phone, who told him to dig a snowcave and crawl inside his sleeping bag. The father called police, and two four-person search and rescue teams started up the mountain at about 5 p.m. Poor conditions forced authorities to call off the search at 11 p.m., Malan said. Rescuers reassembled at 8 a.m. Wednesday and, with the help of a Utah Highway Patrol helicopter, were able to locate Grimley within about 15 minutes. He was standing on North Ogden Ridge waving his arms to get the attention of the pilot, Utah Highway Patrol Capt. Steve Rugg said. Grimley appeared to be in good condition, so Rugg continued searching for Grimley's friend, Phillip Burnett, who was spotted about five minutes later down a deep ravine. Burnett was in a sleeping bag and looked like he'd been injured, Rugg said. After calling for a medical helicopter equipped with a hoist to retrieve Burnett, Rugg returned to pick up Grimley. ""He seemed to be in very good shape,"" Rugg said. ""He spent the night in the snowcave so he weathered out the storm that way."" Burnett had a sleeping bag but had lost his pack with the rest of his gear somewhere along the way, Malan said. Burnett was taken to McKay-Dee Hospital, where he was treated for exposure and released Wednesday afternoon. Rugg said the search area was narrowed significantly because Grimley had been in contact with searchers on his cell phone. ""This was pretty fast,"" Rugg said. ""A lot of times we can be anywhere from hours to days on searches."" Rugg was called to join the search Tuesday night, but the adverse weather prevented him from flying. Although both men have experience with winter camping, Malan said conditions on the mountain Tuesday night were harsh -- at least 60 mph winds and temperatures that dipped well below zero. ""It's some extreme conditions up there, and when you do that extreme skiing you've got to expect those conditions to settle in,"" Malan said. Grimley has spent the past four New Year's Eves on the mountain, Malan said. Grimley declined to comment Wednesday when contacted by the Deseret News, though he did say he was feeling fine after his overnight adventure. Luckily, the young men had some supplies, but not enough to adequately withstand the winter weather, Rugg said. ""They were somewhat prepared, but I think they were surprised at how bad the storm got yesterday and last night,"" he said. ""Those boys are very fortunate."" E-mail: awelling@desnews.com "
2003-01-01,"7 charged with assault, rioting in St. Paul melee",2,"Seven men were charged Tuesday with assault and rioting in connection with a fight outside a St. Paul pool hall last week.  Thanh Tran, 24, of Roseville remains in critical condition at Regions Hospital after the Dec. 26 incident, in which he was shot.  A machete, a rifle, a handgun, sticks and knives were involved in two ""group vs. group"" fights, according to criminal complaints filed in Ramsey County District Court. Some of those charged told police that they called others on cell phones to join the 4 a.m. fracas in a pool hall parking lot on Sherburne Avenue near Chatsworth Street. Police reported that more than 20 people were involved in the fighting.  One of the men charged with second-degree rioting, Kevin N. Pham, 26, of St. Paul, had his thumb cut off by a machete during the fight.  Do D. Nguyen, 19, of St. Anthony and Duc H. Vu, 27, of Santa Ana, Calif., were charged with second-degree assault and second-degree rioting. The four others charged with second-degree rioting are Somon Huot, 26, of St. Paul; Duy T. Nguyen, 18, of St. Paul; Hiep N. Chu. 29, of Vadnais Heights, and Duc N. Nguyen, 21, of St. Anthony.  According to the complaint, witnesses told police that Chu and Tran are leaders of a gang known as 007."
2003-01-01,"A great night for a party",3,"As the clock ticked over to 2003, cellphone transmission failures and traffic congestion proved to be the biggest problems of the evening for revellers at one of New Zealand's most popular holiday spots. Thousands of travellers faced a long, hot wait at the entrance to the Coromandel Peninsula when traffic backed up for several kilometres on either side of the notorious one-lane Kopu Bridge near Thames. Vodafone users in the area were unable to call or text on their cellphones from midday yesterday when half of the company's 35 peninsula cell sites stopped transmitting. As midnight approached technicians were still working on the problem and were unable to say when it would be fixed for users to call or text their New Year greetings. Vodafone spokeswoman Sarah Williams said congestion was not the cause of the failure and she hoped people would keep trying to use their cellphones during the evening. Telecom reported no problems with its mobile network. An absence of boy racers and an unpacked Queen Street marked the beginning of the New Year in central Auckland. While the night was still young at 11pm, the streets were quieter than the average Friday night. The only lively spot on Queen Street was a church group singing in front of Mid-City, who managed to block the footpath with clapping admirers. While down at Aotea Square's family event, First Night, revellers seemed more attuned to the food stalls than the concert going on at the time. But despite rumours of potential bomb scares at the Viaduct Basin, bar owners noticed big crowds - some even bigger than last year. Danny Doolan's general manager, Gary Connolly said they stopped letting people in at 11pm because it was too packed. ""We started picking up at 9pm - we were a bit worried about the bomb rumours, but a lot of people have come in now and there's queues all around the area."" Milano Bar reported it was busier this year compared to last year and Spy bar expected punters to party on until midday. ""Last year it was absolutely nuts and we're expecting it to get like that after 12.30. Even though there's three big dance parties I'm guessing they'll come here as a destination bar and if they want to stay past midday, we'll stay open longer,"" said Chris Barron, manager of Spy Bar. As the midnight countdown approached a helicopter hovered overhead and two ambulances were on standby at the entrance to Princes Wharf. Police said the crowd was slightly better behaved than last year with just 30 arrests between 10pm and midnight across Auckland City for liquor ban breaches. Auckland were treated to an impressive fireworks display at midnight from the Sky Tower, although it caused a traffic jam with cars bottling up in streets around the tower as motorists readied themselves for a good position to watch the display. Last New Year's Eve the display brought traffic to a standstill in some inner city streets. The Coromandel Peninsula is one of the most popular summer holiday destinations for revellers, and towns such as Whangamata, Coromandel and Whitianga more than treble in population. Around 152,000 people visit the area each year. But travelling to the peninsula is not always a relaxing trip, and yesterday's long queues at the Kopu Bridge frustrated thousands of motorists forced to sit in hot cars waiting for the bridge traffic lights to change. Motorists face at least five more years of having to queue at the one-land bridge until a replacement is built. The problem was compounded by a logjam of cars on the Thames side of the bridge, waiting to turn on to State Highway 26, which links Thames and the Kopu-Hikuai turnoff. Communication problems also caused confusion further up the peninsula and led to a delay of nearly three hours before an ambulance arrived to treat a man with a serious leg injury. The 21-year-old was hurt when a car rammed into the back of a parked car, pinning him, at Waikawau Bay Farm Camp near Coromandel just after 2pm. Generally, all was quiet around the country as revellers prepared for the countdown to midnight. Eventually thousands of young people gathered at Whangamata's Williamson Park, where bands Xcalibre and Contagious were on stage. But celebrations got off to a slow start in the town's surf club, with only a handful of people gathering for the 8pm start of entertainment. Private celebrations were in full swing, however, with large groups filling outdoor areas of almost every second property - avoiding the liquor ban by not venturing outside their own land with alcohol. Police continued to enforce the town's liquor ban, which by yesterday morning had resulted in the arrest of nearly 400 young people. In Mt Maunganui only 43 people were in the makeshift police cells ""Alkatraz"" by 11.30pm - only half the number of those arrested last year. Senior Sergeant Duncan MacLeod said police were very pleased with the night, and said the atmosphere was very family-orientated. Police had made a visible impact as they strolled along the beachfront town during the evening wearing flourescent yellow jackets. Two furniture trucks parked behind the police station and set up with beds for youngsters who had over-indulged had yet to be used at midnight. There had been 285 arrests from Boxing Day - when anti-social behaviour was targeted as part of Operation Lustrate - until last evening. Most had been for breaches of the 24-hour liquor bans, which cover most of Mt Maunganui's central business district, downtown Tauranga and parts of Papamoa until January 6. Flouting the ban can cost up to $500. ""There is a relaxed atmosphere and a general holiday mood,"" Mr MacLeod agreed. ""Let's hope it stays that way."" In Rotorua, crowds gathered at the lakefront for a big concert, to be followed by fireworks at midnight. At the Haruru Falls concert near Paihia, high-profile Kiwi acts rocked young revellers into the New Year. But early on, concertgoers were kept in the dark over when bands and singers such as Che Fu, Tadpole and Fur Patrol were playing after organisers decided not to print programmes with the order of performances. ""You don't know what is happening when,"" said Olivia Willard, who had travelled north from Wellington. In Whangamata, police were tonight investigating a hit-and-run in which a 12-year-old boy received minor injuries on Monday night. The boy was thrown on to the windscreen and carried on the bonnet for a couple of metres before falling off the car in Hauturu St. The small, white hatchback, drove on without stopping."
2003-01-01,"A mild goose hunt",4,"FERGUS FALLS, Minn. -- It was just after 9 a.m. and the geese were finally coming out of town, exactly as Mike Jacobs predicted.  We were out of bed at 5 a.m., setting decoys by 6 and ready to shoot by 7:30. But December geese often keep banker's hours, and we hadn't seen a bird in the air. We were discussing whether to sneak back to town for a quick breakfast and some hot coffee. But that changed just after 9 a.m.  Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of big Canada geese were leaving their water roost in the city and heading out to feed in farm fields on a blustery December morning. And a big bunch was headed right at us.  'When they come up over the hill from town and out of that gap between those two telephone poles, that's our zone. Those are the ones we want,' Jacobs advised.  Jacobs should know. He's shot hundreds of geese in this field over the past decade or so. Jacobs, who lives in Royalton, Minn., grew up in the Fergus Falls area, where his parents and brother still live.  'Those are in the zone. Start calling!' Jacobs said. 'And keep flagging.'  So we blew into our short-reed goose calls with gusto and waved goose 'flags,' T-shaped black cloth on a stick that's supposed to look like a goose landing.  Skeins of geese, V's of geese, pairs and unorganized flocks -- all of them seemed to converge on us at once. At one point we had more than 100 geese within 100 yards, many seeming to hover just outside our decoys. Just as one group was about to land, another would cross its path. It looked like a disorganized air show.  That's when Eric Jorgensen's cell phone rang.  'I can't talk now, man. We're under attack,' said the hunter before quickly hanging up.  But amid the clamor of geese and three hunters calling from inside a pit in the ground, no one fired a shot.  Amazingly, no one said 'Take 'em.' None of us called the shot. Maybe we were too mesmerized by the number of birds in the air. Each of us probably had decent shots to take but we waited too long for the perfect shot that never came. The geese slipped away to feed somewhere else.  'I can't believe we didn't get a goose out of that,' Jorgensen said.  'There were too many of them,' Jacobs said.  But it didn't matter. In the next hour or so, dozens of geese would come well within range -- some of them just a few feet from our faces -- their big wings set, gliding into our decoys.  And so we readily obliged the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' goal to reduce the growing flock of geese that spend the entire winter in Fergus Falls.  By the time we picked up our decoys at 1 p.m., the dogs had retrieved 14 geese, just one shy of our daily limit.  Large stretches of the Ottertail River remain open in and near Fergus Falls, even through the coldest winters, thanks to a local power plant, dams and fast-moving water.  All that open water has, over the past 20 years, become a magnet for increasing numbers of giant Canada geese that nest across the farm ponds and wetlands of western and northwestern Minnesota. When other lakes and swamps freeze, many of those geese head to Fergus Falls instead of migrating south.  By early December, more than 10,000 geese are spending most of their day in the city. After they run out of grass, they have to head out of town to feed in farmers' fields. Another 15,000 geese still are keeping the nearby Orwell Reservoir ice-free as well, making for a high concentration of huntable birds.  Duluth army heads west  This is the second year that a group of Duluth area hunters has joined Jacobs on his annual trip home for the December goose season.  Jacobs, who lived for a short time in Cloquet, hosted eight of us. Together we shot 45 Canada geese in a day-and-a-half.  But it started slow.  A few geese came close enough to look at our spread but veered off without landing. They apparently saw or heard something they didn't like.  While these may be tame-looking critters in town, the birds quickly regain their keen instincts to avoid trouble when outside the city limits. These geese are hunted hard for four months each fall -- during a special September season, during the regular October-November waterfowl season, and now for eight days in December. They wise up fast to mediocre calling, poorly placed decoys or hunters who aren't concealed.  But not all of the geese snubbed us. The action never got fast that first day, but enough geese flew to keep us busy calling and flagging, especially around 11 a.m. That's when a flock of five big geese circled our massive spread of fake geese, their necks craned, searching for the source of our goose calls below.  This time, we must have done everything right. The geese answered our calls. We were well hidden in our camouflage-covered blinds. The dogs didn't move. And the five geese set their wings to land.  They made the mistake of flying directly in front of all nine of us as they came in to land. And nearly all of us sat up to shoot.  One-by-one, all five geese folded and fell.  Sunset came with no big flurry but at least one last surprise. Just as we were about to pick up decoys, a group of five huge trumpeter swans flew past our decoys just a few feet off the ground. As most of us stopped to admire the big birds, a few noticed a lone Canada goose following in formation at the end of the group.  Someone grabbed a goose call and gave a few clucks. Someone yelled for anybody with a loaded gun to shoot. Even though several of us were standing in the decoys, the goose was coming in to land.  Duluth's Mike Marmon grabbed his 10-gauge, rammed in a single shell and fired just as the bird figured out he was making a huge mistake.  The 11th and final goose of the day fell to the ground."
2003-01-03,"AJC INTERVIEW / CATHERINE ZETA-JONES: Jazzed about 'Chicago'",5,"THE MOVIE ""Chicago"" Starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere. Directed by Rob Marshall. Rated PG-13 for sexual content and dialogue, violence and thematic elements. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 53 minutes.   * On ajc.com: Read AJC film critic Eleanor Ringel Gillespie's review of ""Chicago."" Grade: A- AJC New York --- Not every woman does leg splits between having babies. But that's Catherine Zeta-Jones' MO. Birth a baby. Film ""Chicago,"" with its hot-jazz, leg-splitting opening number, ""All That Jazz."" Birth a baby. Baby No. 2 with husband Michael Douglas is due in April, she says while placing her right hand atop her tummy. She's wearing perfectly chic black stretch pants, exposed under a perfectly chic black top. ""This movie was really physically demanding, and it was my idea to do it after I'd had a baby,"" Zeta-Jones says. "" 'Oh, my God,' I thought. 'Whose bright idea was this?' "" As the musical's smart, calculating, headline-grabbing vaudeville diva Velma Kelly, Zeta-Jones opens the film with the blistering ""All That Jazz."" As she belts out the words and dances, a line of male hoofers hoists her into the air, extending her legs into a flawless split. The 33-year-old, Welsh-born actress got her start on the English stage in musicals. So she does splits all the time. Right? ""Never,"" Zeta-Jones says. ""Never did a split from the moment I [previously] put my dance shoes up. Of course, I couldn't do it when I started doing this movie. I was terrified about being lifted up by these guys. I thought, I'm sure I'm too heavy. They're going to collapse under me, and I'm going to break my neck."" Obviously, nothing got broken. Her co-stars talk about her ferocity in preparing and performing for ""Chicago."" The film is full of show-stopping numbers not only from Zeta-Jones but also from co-stars Renee Zellweger (as Roxie Hart), Richard Gere, John C. Reilly and Queen Latifah. Reilly has noted the tenacity in the film's two leading ladies, Zeta-Jones and Zellweger. ""I would not want to battle them for a taxi,"" he says. Critics are heaping praise on the movie. ""Chicago,"" as much about the unquenchable thirst for celebrity as it is about song-and-dance numbers, landed a leading eight nominations for this month's Golden Globes, including best motion picture musical or comedy, director and nods for each of its five main stars. Though she has a musical background, many American filmgoers are more familiar with Zeta-Jones as a dramatic actress. She made ""The Mask of Zorro"" (1998); ""Entrapment,"" with Sean Connery (1999); ""The Haunting"" (1999); ""High Fidelity"" (2000); and Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic."" There was also the comedy ""America's Sweethearts"" (2001), with Julia Roberts. A pregnant Zeta-Jones recently sat down (gingerly) in her New York hotel suite to talk about ""Chicago,"" the difference between making musicals and dramas and her recent cellphone ad campaign. She also spoke about a little item she treasures on almost all her film sets: a karaoke machine. AJC: How did you go about finding Velma? ZETA-JONES: I always knew the music but didn't really know the story. But what I learned from Bill Condon's script and [director] Rob Marshall's vision was that I didn't have a lot of deep scene work that would explain Velma's character. So I had to nail her from the moment she finishes that first number. What I wanted to do was find nuances that weren't explained but were so characteristic of her. She's desperate to be on top. She's ruthless. Everything about her is on show. And she wants everyone to love her. It's greed and love of celebrity. AJC: And what about the regimen of singing and dancing again? ZETA-JONES: It was like being in a boot camp. Yes, I've danced before, but it was a long time ago. I had to get back the style and the edginess and the stamina and the flexibility. It was tough. And just tuning up the voice. I've never rehearsed so intensely for a movie in my life, and I probably won't ever again. AJC: It was while you were making ""America's Sweethearts"" that I first heard about you and your traveling karaoke machine. ZETA-JONES: It's a bizarre thing. I always like to have a karaoke machine in my trailer. I like to sing sometimes. AJC: What do you sing? ZETA-JONES: Oh, the standards, from the Carpenters to Simon and Garfunkel. Good old tunes. I release a lot of tension by belting out songs. People would laugh. My brother was with me one time, and he's a bit of a karaoke freak, too. So I'd go back to my trailer and I'd hear ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" blaring. It's fun. It passes the time. I didn't have a karaoke machine on ""Chicago"" for obvious reasons. I had enough singing and dancing and enough music around. But on my other films, I have had one. Even on ""Traffic."" AJC: There was a commentary piece in the Chicago Tribune that criticized your cellphone ads. It basically said, ""Why would someone of the stature of Catherine Zeta-Jones do this?"" ZETA-JONES: They gave me an offer I couldn't refuse. It's a business venture I wanted to partake in. The industry is not just about showing up and knowing your lines anymore. The movie studios are conglomerates. AOL Time Warner. Viacom. The Internet business. Technology. It's all mixed up in the same bag. And [it's] like I have an Elizabeth Arden contract. Same as Halle Berry. I'm a complete gadget freak. AJC: ""Traffic"" and ""Chicago"" are really your best works to date. They are two different genres. Is it easier to get into playing one more than the other? ZETA-JONES: Having that rehearsal period for ""Chicago"" was something I cherished, because I can flesh out so much. Try certain things and fall flat on your face and then come back up again. It gives you the time to do that. With ""Traffic,"" it's scarier. The way Steven [Soderbergh] shoots, it's very different. He has the camera on his shoulder. He's sitting in the car with you while you're doing the scene, filming it. It's spontaneous to the point of ""Don't say that line, say something like this"" or ""Improvise something there."" They are two completely different styles. And I like them both the same. I find them both challenging. AJC: And you've done a Coen brothers movie with George Clooney, the upcoming ""Intolerable Cruelty."" That must be different again. ZETA-JONES: Yes. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. We'd be doing scenes with me and George, and they'd be snickering behind the camera --- to the point they had to stop shooting. It would just crack them up. And the amazing thing is we were always done for the day at 2 in the afternoon because they were so prepared. Everything they have on the schedule is done. And I'm like, ""Don't you want to do another take?"" ""No,"" one of them would say. ""I think we've got it.""

2003-01-03,"Ban cell use while driving",6,"It would garner widespread opposition from legions of cellphone owners, but B.C. would do well to follow Newfoundland's lead and ban the use of hand-held cellphones while driving. It makes sense. We're taught to drive with both hands on the steering wheel. Anyone will agree that driving with one hand in most situations is more dangerous than driving with two. Now add the distraction of carrying on a conversation with a phone pinned to your ear while driving in tight traffic or dicey situations. Driving while talking on a cellphone is like most anything else; it takes getting used to. But regardless of how experienced a driver/talker is, it stands to reason that a driver's reaction time is compromised when he or she is concentrating on two tasks at once. And one of those tasks -- keeping an automobile out of trouble -- is obviously far more important than the other. There is no shortage of drivers who can tell their story of a near-miss while he or she was talking on a cellphone. Surprisingly, the Canada Safety Council says cellphone use by drivers doesn't make highways more dangerous. The council notes there are now 10 million cellphones in Canada compared to 1.8 million in 1993, but during that time traffic fatalities and injuries dropped 10 per cent. It's a good bet that safer cars and highways are responsible for the decline in fatalities and injuries, including those accidents involving drivers who were using a cellphone at the time. Conversely, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found talking on a cellphone -- whether hand-held or a hands-free phone -- while driving was responsible for a four-fold increase in the risk of being in an accident. Particularly alarming is the abundance of young drivers who talk on cellphones while behind the wheel. Statistics show younger drivers are already the most accident prone. Their inexperience -- both in regular driving and accident avoidance -- is compounded by the distraction of concentrating on a conversation, not to mention the loss of one hand from the wheel. The Pacific province should copy its Atlantic sister's lead. Banning the use of cellphones while driving would make Newfoundland and British Columbia common-sense bookends on the map of Canada. It's the right call."
2003-01-01,"Battle for Blues  helsea out to gun down Arsenal",7,"Soccer English Premier League LONDON: Chelsea's biggest hurdle to winning the English soccer title for the first time since 1955 is not Arsenal, but themselves.  Chelsea's title credentials will be tested early tomorrow morning (Queensland time) in a London derby that the often inconsistent Blues need to win to haul in Arsenal's five- point lead.  ""Our battle is not against Arsenal, but against ourselves,"" said Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri. ""Everyone likes to put Arsenal and Chelsea together, but we're only concerned with our own performance.  ""The points difference now is not important.  ""Chelsea is Chelsea and we shouldn't be thinking about Arsenal, Manchester United or Liverpool.""  Defending champions Arsenal have 43 points, with Chelsea and Manchester United on 38 points. Newcastle and Everton have 35 points in a tie for fourth place, with Liverpool on 34 points.  Premier League clubs are lining up for their third matches in five days and minor injuries have hit many of them.  Those doubtful include Liverpool's Michael Owen (hamstring), Manchester United's Ruud van Nistelrooy (toe), Everton's Kevin Campbell (ankle), Newcastle's Kieron Dyer (calf) and Leeds' Harry Kewell (leg).  In other key games, Manchester United meet Sunderland, Newcastle host Liverpool, Everton are at home to Manchester City and Leeds play Birmingham.  Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said Arsenal's 1-1 draw was a boost.  ""The draw has given us a glimmer of hope again,"" said Ferguson.  ""We have to make sure the glimmer gets stronger.""  Liverpool seek their first win in 10 games. They have just four points from a possible 27 this month and are on their worst league run since 1954.  Newcastle will be without midfielders Gary Speed, Dyer and Nolberto Solano, who all picked up injuries in Monday's 2-1 win over Tottenham.  Everton's visit to Manchester City is unique as it is the first time two Chinese players could meet in the Premier League. Both are defenders who played at the World Cup.  Everton's Li Tie signed in August, prompting Chinese cell phone company Kejian to sponsor their shirts. Sun Jihai joined then-first division Manchester City in February, helping the club to promotion to the Premier League.  Leeds' teenage prodigy James Milner could make his first Premier League start against Birmingham. On Friday, he became the youngest player to score in the Premier League in Leeds' 2-1 win over Sunderland and again scored against Chelsea.  Now paid around $230 a week as a trainee, Milner can earn 10 times that when he turns 17 on Saturday.  ""There's not much missing from his performance,"" said Leeds manager Terry Venables.  ""He has a lot in his locker."""
2003-01-03,"Belarus Science Official Seeks Compensation for Brain Drain; Japanese Students Caught in Cellphone Cheating Scam",8,"The president of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus has a message for the West, which has been only too happy to employ the country's dwindling cadre of professors and scientists: You owe us. Mikhail Myasnikovich, the academy's president, proposes that Western organizations, as well as the countries in which they operate, in some way compensate Belarus for the brain drain that has continued steadily since independence in 1991. ""Right now it is too early to speak about results. We are still working out the details,"" Vladimir Podkopaev, head of the academy's division of international relations, said last month. The proposal would help protect the country's vital interests, Mr. Myasnikovich said at an October press conference in Minsk, the capital. He said compensation should be made not only to the Belarusian government, but also to all of the organizations -- including state universities and research institutes -- that the academics and scientists have left behind. Educating somebody through the doctoral level can cost the government as much as $600,000, Mr. Myasnikovich said. About 70 professors and scientists each year have left Belarus since 1996, the first year for which figures are available, according to the academy's Center for the Monitoring of Immigration of Scientific Personnel. But Yury Khodyko, a physicist with the academy, said the government has no right to request compensation, because working conditions for scientists in the country are so poor. ""Scientists are also people, and they have the right to choose a place for the realization of their abilities,"" he told the BelaPAN news agency. Physicists and mathematicians in Belarus earn an average of $120 per month, government statistics show. On the day before Mr. Myasnikovich's remarks, Nikolai Korbut, the finance minister, proposed a $5-million cut in the government's support of the sciences, to help provide money for back wages owed to state employees. *** A university in Tokyo has failed 26 students for cheating on their e-commerce final exams, by using the e-mail functions on their cellphones. Professors became suspicious when identical answers -- mistakes and all -- showed up on the test, which was taken by about 500 students in July, the Associated Press reported. Takehiko Sugiyama, vice president of Hitotsubashi University, said officials believe that a student left the classroom during the exam and sent the answers to his classmates in an e-mail message via his cellphone. Later, 26 students admitted to cheating after they did poorly on a subsequent exam. The university decided not to suspend the 26, but they were failed on the test, Mr. Sugiyama said."
2003-01-03,"BOYCOTT CINEMAS",9," I agree with the views expressed by Louis Wong in the letter headlined ""Selfish mobile phone users"" (South China Morning Post, December 27). I have had similar unpleasant experiences in cinemas. If movie-goers cannot maintain their silence and cinema managers cannot do anything to improve the situation, people should stop going to the cinema.  Those members of the audience who use mobile phones are being selfish by disturbing other people. I think only education within the family can help to change attitudes with future generations.  I also think cinema operators could do more to try and provide their customers with a genuinely enjoyable environment, even though they claim they have considered installing some kind of cellular phone-blocking device.  I have never seen any cinema staff stopping people using their mobile phones, chatting or smoking. Film-makers and distributors are also failing to consider the problems associated with cellphones. They just complain about how the poor state of the economy is affecting their income.  Rather than tolerating these inconsiderate film-goers, I have decided to stay away from cinemas and watch films now in the comfort of my own home.  ROSE YUEN  Causeway Bay"

You also will likely hear a plethora of creative, heartfelt profanity that, if the wind is right, will trigger shelter-in-place sirens throughout the Greater Kanawha Valley. So how can a manly-man game turn otherwise manly men into Nancy Boys? Observe. A good 95 percent of the time, a man doesn't give a whit about his personal appearance. On Game Day, however, he will not leave the house unless the star on his Cowboys cap is perfectly aligned or his Kordell Stewart #10 jersey is fitting just so. And while women get a bad rap about yakking too much, there is none so verbal as a male football fan. Get two guys, complete strangers, in a bar any time of the day or night. Should one or both be wearing football-oriented apparel, this will automatically initiate a lifelong friendship or an enmity to make the Hatfield-McCoy Feud a barn dance in comparison. As Charlie Daniels once sang, ""You just go and lay your hands on a Pittsburgh Steelers fan, and I think you're gonna find out what I mean."" If I ever laid my hands on a Pittsburgh Steelers fan, I think I'd want to wash my hands right away. But I digress. Basically, when it comes to football, you can't shut a guy up, unless his team gets gobsmacked on Sunday and he doesn't show his face in public until Friday or Saturday, after a proper mourning period and to avoid well-earned derision, to start running his yap again. It is essential to know vital statistics on every member of every roster in the NFL, because this is knowledge. And knowledge is power, particularly when you have been known on occasion to gamble away a week's pay on the spread or spend half your waking hours tending to your fantasy football team like a bed of rare Asian orchids in a hothouse. So, although they might not say a dozen words to their wives and children throughout the week, men will talk incessantly about football at the drop of a hat (or a drop of a Tommy Maddox pass). They will talk about the glory days of the past. They will talk about the draft and the promise of the future. They will call each other repeatedly during the game to confirm if they have both seen the exact same play. There are few things as sad as watching a beer-sotted, Browns-shirted construction worker with male pattern baldness and a gut like the Michelin Man's, only bigger, shrieking like a spider monkey into his cellphone over a vaguely spectacular play that will probably be overturned by a coach's challenge anyway. If a man is at home watching football by himself, he is fully absorbed in the game at hand. This is not a good time to discuss issues, ladies, for he must concentrate on strategy and has no time for idle banter such as a fever-laden child, your emotional needs or the fact that the kitchen fire is spreading into the hallway. Spare us your chin music, wenches! In the company of men during football, however, even Marcel Marceau would yammer away about every play during a game, either how awesome or stupid it was, for there is little middle ground in this clash of modern-day gladiators. Perhaps it is something in the reptilian brain, but a man must express his reaction verbally to virtually every play of the game, be it a grunt or a Shakespearean sonnet of profanity. This makes perfect sense if you're at the stadium, to root for your team or heckle the opponents, but the only ones who hear you around a TV set are a bunch of other half-informed buffoons wearing two days' growth of beard and Packers or Dolphins sweatshirts. Lack of affection? I daresay that are few other public places where men will hug complete strangers of the same gender without Madonna or a showtune on the jukebox. As for guys who genuinely cry when their team loses - well, a gentleman never tells. Such things should remain a secret among men behind closed saloon doors. Although never actually playing football, Metro staff reporter Clint Thomas was a throwback in high school and a drawback in college."
2003-01-03,"BRIGHT DIGITAL DISPLAYS COULD LEAP FROM CELL PHONES TO TV SCREENS",11,"* A new technology that uses organic molecules might make innovations in lighting more dramatic than those in consumer electronics. A new technology that makes cell-phone screens glow like a firefly's tail might be destined to brighten displays on everything from television sets to digital cameras. Built on organic molecules, or polymers, that glow when they're electrified, the technology could spur the creation of roll-up computer screens that fit in a breast pocket or sheets of radiant lighting that shimmer like the aurora borealis. ""Imagine a plastic film or a fiber-optic cable that emits light, that you can bend in any shape you want,"" said Stewart Hough, vice president at Cambridge Display Technologies. ""It's one of those limited-by-your-imagination things."" Hough's company is developing a polymer-based version of the technology, known as organic light-emitting diodes, or OLEDs. A diode is a piece of electronics in which current flows in only one direction. Chemical, electronic and lighting companies -- such as Kodak, Samsung, Philips, DuPont -- are pouring money into research and development of OLEDs, rushing tiny screens to market and scrambling to race ahead of competitors. For now, the monochrome screens appear on a handful of products: cell phones, MP3 players, car stereos. As the bright screens mature into full-color displays with an active matrix that permits video, analysts say, they'll jump to digital-camera displays, auto dashboards, laptop screens and TV sets. Estimated at $80 million in 2002, global sales of OLEDs are expected to hit $2.3 billion by 2008, said Kimberly Allen, research director at iSuppl i/Stanford Resources, a firm that tracks the industry. As the technology progresses, analysts say, it will replace the silicon-based LCD, or liquid crystal display, that's used in everything from watches and calculators to flat-screen monitors and some TV sets. OLED screens comprise arrays of tiny diodes made of organic materials used in plastics and polymers. The diodes in today's little screens are sandwiched between layers of glass, glowing in various colors as electricity flows through them. The delicate organics wither and die at a hint of moisture, so glass is needed to keep them dry. Experts say it will be a decade or so before someone figures out how to make a durable OLED screen on a plastic base, perhaps a flexible one, which would require flexible circuit boards and other components. A few companies, including DuPont and Bell Labs, are working on bendable plastic electronics for such a screen. ""You could put it on curved surfaces,"" said Alan Heeger, professor of physics at the University of California at Santa Barbara. ""You can imagine nifty-looking things."" Heeger, whose discoveries in polymer conductivity earned him and two colleagues a Nobel prize in 2000, said the innovations in lighting could be more dramatic than those in consumer electronics. OLEDs, coupled with mature, inorganic LED technology that brightens traffic signals and auto taillights, could replace incandescent and fluorescent light bulbs with wallpaper that changes lighting patterns and colors, sheets of radiant film that could be cut to size, or light cords that accent walls, handrails or steps, Heeger said. Today's products are comparatively mundane. The first OLED emerged in a Pioneer car stereo in 1998. Since, others have shown up in cell phones made by Motorola, Fujitsu and LG; an MP3 player made by Taiwanese firm Delta Optoelectronics; and a Philips men's shaver sold under the Norelco brand. The shaver, with an orange screen that displays battery life, turned up in the latest James Bond movie, ""Die Another Day."" For next year, Samsung is making a cell phone with the first full-color OLED display, for sale in South Korea. Kodak is shipping 2-inch horizontal OLED screens to a consumer-device manufacturer that it declined to name. The screens, configured in the manner of those used in digital cameras, are the first to use active-matrix technology that can play video, said Daniel Gisser of Kodak's display-products unit. The product will emerge in the first half of 2003, he said. Larger screens for hand-held computers and video cameras might be ready in a year or two, said Paul O'Donovan, a Gartner Dataquest analyst. Prototypes of 15- and 17-inch screens have been cooked up, but none is expected to hit stores for years. O'Donovan said OLED monitors for personal computers might be available in four to five years, with TV sets in five to 10 years. ""The trouble is scaling them up,"" O'Donovan said. ""They've got a 2.5-inch screen working impressively. The real technological leap will be to expand these into the replacement of televisions."" One manufacturing technique, pioneered by Cambridge Display Technologies in Britain, allows the screens to be printed by inkjets that can spray glow-producing polymers onto sheets of glass. In a few years, analysts and experts predict, the onset of flexible plastic displays will allow roll-to-roll printing, making the screens far cheaper to build than an LCD, which must be assembled in a vacuum. OLED screens have several other advantages. Because their polymers emit light, they do away with the power-sucking backlight used by LCD screens. Without the backlight, the screens are lighter and thinner - display models are just a quarter-inch thick - and run longer on a smaller battery. In cell phones, this means longer talk time between charges. OLED screens also respond to movement much faster, allowing them to play video without the blurry muddle of LCD screens. Colors are sharper, and contrast is higher, making 2-inch screens large enough for TV watchin g. The screens can be viewed from wide angles, unlike most LCDs. And the manufacturing process produces less toxic waste. But today's screens start to degrade after about 10,000 hours of use, with blue pixels dimming sooner than others, O'Donovan said. As colors die, the screens take on a magenta hue, he said. This means OLEDs aren't ready for long-life products, such as TV sets and computer monitors. For now, they'll appear in products with short life cycles, such as hand-held computers, digital cameras and cell phones. ""There's a lot of money going into (research and development), and a lot of companies are working on it,"" O'Donovan said. ""These problems could be solved sooner rather than later.""

2003-01-01,"Businesses donate supplies, service to fund 'Higher quality toy' possible because of firms' gifts to annual holiday effort",12,"Not all donations to The Spokesman-Review Christmas Bureau are monetary.  Each year, dozens of area businesses give everything from cell phone service  for the bureau to plastic bags for the toys.  ''These businesses make incredible donations that we couldn't do without,""  said Sally Quirk, Christmas Bureau volunteer coordinator.  For example, Dave McGann - owner of the area Arby's Roast Beef Restaurants  - delivered 1,219 sandwiches at greatly reduced prices to the Christmas Bureau  for the volunteers. In addition, McGann worked at the bureau as a volunteer  for seven of the 10 days. ''What these businesses donate, whether it's computers or reduced price  chairs, makes it possible for us to provide a higher quality toy,"" Quirk  said. ''It allows us to offer child care while the parent selects the toy, and  safety measures, such as wheelchairs.""  The computers, for instance, are vital to the smooth operation of the  bureau, Quirk said. ''They also safeguard the intentions of the monetary  donors,"" she said, by making sure people only go through the bureau once.  As a salute to the area businesses who helped make the Christmas Bureau  happen, here are the outright donations, atcost donations and services they  provided:  Arby's Roast Beef Restaurants: 1,219 sandwiches at a reduced cost of $1.25  each for the bureau volunteers.  Correctional Industries of Airway Heights Correctional Center: reduced  price for volunteers' sweat shirts, free design and production of bureau  signs, loan of computer equipment.

2003-01-03,"CHAMPAGNE THIEF LIKES THE GOOD STUFF",14,"Madison police are looking for a man with a taste for expensive champagne. Madison Police Officer David Dexheimer said the man entered the Bottle Stop liquor store, 2734 E. Washington Ave., about 6:10 p.m. on New Year's Eve and asked a clerk about the champagne selection. A shorter version of the story appeared in the second edition on page B3. The headline was: Champagne thief likes the pricey stuffAfter the clerk pulled down two $140 bottles of Perrier Jouet, the man made a call on his cell phone, apparently to decide whether to buy them. But when the clerk had his back turned, Dexheimer said, the man grabbed the bottles and ran out the door. One of the bottles smashed on the pavement. With store clerks tailing him, the man gave up trying to jump into a car parked on Pawling Street and fled on foot. The car was later found to have been stolen, Dexheimer said. About 15 minutes later, one of the clerks, still on the hunt, found the man crouched in some bushes, but couldn't catch him. The man also tried but was unable to jump into another car, apparently driven by a friend, as it passed on Kedzie Street, Dexheimer said. Police are still looking for the man. The second bottle of pricey wine, however, is back at the store after it was found unharmed in a yard."
2003-01-02,"Cities plan for bioterror attacks U.S. communities test preparedness for anthrax, smallpox outbreaks",15,"TUCSON, Ariz. - Jeanne Williquett is playing her part well in a bioterrorism drama meant to test this city's readiness for an attack. She desperately tells anyone who will listen that she has anthrax. ""I have a fever,"" she tells a nurse, who nods along, trying to calm her. ""They say anthrax starts with a fever."" Volunteers like Williquett, a hospice nurse, are helping local planners test Tucson's ability to quickly distribute antibiotics to a large number of people in response to a bioterrorist attack. It's the sort of exercise other states and cities are likely to run as they work to upgrade and test their response systems. The federal government already has handed out $ 1 billion to help states plan for bioterrorism, with more on the way, and states are required to show they are making progress. Just this month, federal officials conducted their own bioterrorism war game at the White House, playing out their response to a hypothetical international smallpox attack. In Tucson, the three-day drill in November illustrated both the power and limitations of bioterrorism planning. Real nurses worked to calm Williquett and deal with other crises. But those in charge knew even before the test began exactly how the disaster was to unfold and just how they would handle it. Local officials say simply planning the exercise helped them prepare for a real disaster, forcing coordination among police, fire, public health, pharmacists and others. ""When the big event happens, you have to know the person on the other end of that line is someone you can trust and is going to do the job,"" said Les Caid, a battalion chief for the Tucson Fire Department, a chief organizer. But outside experts caution that if exercises aren't challenging enough, they can offer a false sense of security. In Tucson, local planners are ahead of much of the nation, but it isn't clear whether the exercise actually tested their readiness for the worst. Nationally, there is much work to be done. Just one state, Florida, is ready to receive the federal stockpile of drugs and medical supplies needed in a disaster, according to a federal assessment this fall, although other states may have improved since then. At the same time, many communities have little clue how they would handle a surge of injured patients or produce enough isolation beds to keep a crush of infectious people away from others. A slew of new hires in public health, upgraded computer systems, detailed planning and drills like Tucson's are aimed at helping communities move ahead. Bioterrorism planners from around the country came to watch Tucson's drill, looking for ideas. ""If something were to happen now, everyone has plans in place,"" said Vernon Jones, lead coordinator for the Fresco, Calif., Metropolitan Medical Response System. But independent plans developed by various local agencies aren't integrated, he said. Jones plans to develop plans to deliver mass smallpox vaccinations and conduct a drill. Asked if he could vaccinate the 600,000 people in his community within a few days of an attack, he said bluntly: ""No, nobody can."" In Montgomery County, Md., officials staged an exercise this fall that county police Capt. Mike Collins said identified several problems: Hospitals couldn't reach the public health department because someone had turned off the telephone ringer, and while they identified needed medical supplies, they didn't know how to get them. In rural Graham County, Ariz., bioterrorism coordinator Dolores Herrera says the preparations are overwhelming. ""It's so vague,"" she said. ""Everything is a concept."" She said the county does not yet have a plan to dispense medicine in a mass attack. Being in an isolated rural county two hours northeast of Tucson makes preparation particularly challenging, she said. ""You only have so many nurses, so many doctors, so many pharmacists."" And county officials have contacts but ""no solid relationships"" on Indian reservations. The Tucson drill begins on a Wednesday when two men wielding fire extinguishers spray white gas representing anthrax spores onto a luncheon crowd. Officials confirm that it's anthrax, and Arizona's governor immediately calls the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to request backup medical supplies. The CDC's National Pharmaceutical Stockpile has 50-ton mobile pharmacies located at 12 sites across the country. These ""push packs,"" which contain antibiotics, vaccines and medical supplies, can be delivered to any town in America inside 12 hours. Early Thursday, a smaller version with pretend medicines arrives at an Arizona Air National Guard hanger. There's no way to know who inhaled the anthrax spores, so anyone at the conference center during the attack will be given antibiotics, just in case. The system works: By the end of the day, antibiotics are distributed to nearly 2,000 people. The drill also succeeds in identifying at least a few holes in the system. The push pack of medicines was driven to Arizona from neighboring New Mexico, and local officials were at the state line to meet it. But the truck driver was operating on Eastern Standard Time while the people waiting were on Mountain Time. They didn't have a cell phone number to reach the driver. At the convention center, the instructional videos played so softly that they were inaudible to anyone more than a foot from the TV. And in the midst of placing orders from the pharmaceutical stockpile, the phone lines went down."
2003-01-02,"City airport beefs up security systems",16,"Air travellers leaving Saskatoon Airport may notice little difference as Canada's new Air Transportation Security Authority (CATSA) takes over, said airport manager Bill Restall. But changes to security are taking place. ""We're working towards making security as effective as possible but as transparent as possible to the travelling public,"" Restall said. The federal agency, established in April, took over operation of airport pre-boarding screening Wednesday. Airlines had previously conducted screening. The StarPhoenix; Saskatchewan News Network One billion dollars of CATSA's five-year, $1.9-billion budget will be used for explosive-detection systems. CATSA has installed trace-detection equipment to screen carry-on luggage, and equipment will do the same for luggage loaded onto airplanes, said Randall McCauley, the agency's vice-president of public affairs. Trace-detection equipment consists of a cotton swab rubbed onto carry-on luggage to check for minute traces of chemicals including explosives. The new equipment allow electronic devices -- such as pagers, cell phones and computers -- to be screened without switching them on, McCauley said. The equipment is expected to be installed at all 89 Canadian airports by 2005. ""Part of the challenge is that they're awfully big machines and fitting them into airports requires a lot of re-engineering and construction work,"" McCauley said. CATSA advises passengers to carry camera film in carry-on luggage, because of potential damage by the new equipment. Saskatoon travellers have become more aware of another security feature that has always been tight at the airport -- tolerance for uttering threats or comments about weapons or bombs. In the 1980s, Saskatoon had the highest rate of passengers being detained for questioning after making careless remarks of any similar-sized airport in the country. ""We've always run a very diligent security system in Saskatoon and that made it very easy for us to adapt to all the new regulations that came out,"" Restall said. ""We don't strive to meet the regulation, we strive to be better than the regulation. ""People are more aware of the circumstances now and are more prudent with their comments."" Rules brought into effect Wednesday in the United States require that all bags be screened by explosive-detection systems (EDS). Canada has a similar law but will phase it in over several years, Restall said. Security requirements prohibit Restall from saying exactly when all of Saskatoon's EDS will be phased in but he said they are already installed throughout the airport, which underwent renovations earlier this year. ""We're putting in security systems that for the most part will be transparent to the passenger but in fact will be the latest, state of the art security systems,"" he said. The changes are part of Canada's national program to meet all international air transportation safety standards, he said. Restall would not say how much the security equipment cost. It was paid for through a combination of grants from CATSA and capital funds raised by the $5 airport improvement user fee charged to any traveller who departs from Saskatoon Airport. That fee, implemented in 1999, is one of the lowest in Canada, Restall said. Most fees are $10, $12 and $15, he said. Air travellers also pay $12 per trip ($24 round trip) as a federal security fee. There is also more security staff at the Saskatoon airport, but Restall would not say how much more. The cost of security has had a dampening effect on air travel, Restall said. Use of Saskatoon Airport was down about six per cent in 2002. ""The $24 Canadian security fee is hurting short-haul service. People who can use another mode of transportation may not fly because of price. That's something we're strongly discussing with the Canadian government. ""The Americans did a survey and found that since Sept. 11, their travel of under 250 miles is down 18 per cent, travel between 250 and 500 miles is down 14 per cent and travel over 500 miles is about the same as before."""

Catalano said she was not allowed to comment, but sports information director Steve Snapp said he had talked with Catalano and ""she said he (Clarett) had not filled out the proper paperwork."" Geiger said in a statement issued last night that Clarett had not submitted a free application form for federal student aid to Ohio State as of Monday. ""Maurice may have begun the process but at the time we had to make the decision there was no indication of an FAFFSA on file for Maurice,"" he said. ""We were therefore compelled to follow the NCAA rules as they apply in this situation."" Clarett said his mother filled out the paperwork last week and he submitted it to the school compliance department, which must approve any finanical aid or benefits given to student athletes. Clarett said he was upset he was not contacted by Catalano after he filed his paperwork. ""The compliance lady said she'd get back to me in my room,"" he said. ""She never called me back in my room or on my cell phone. That's the reason I was mad."" By the end of the hour-long interview, he said he came to Ohio State ""to play football, not to get an education"" and said earlier assertions that he came to the Buckeyes to restore the school's rich tradition was ""just something Steve Snapp told me to say."""
2003-01-01,"COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Ohio State And Clarett Continue Argument",20,"Ohio State tailback Maurice Clarett today disputed the contention of university officials that he failed to file the proper paperwork to allow him to return to his hometown to attend the funeral of a boyhood friend.  Clarett said he filled out the paperwork Thursday, before the Buckeyes departed for their national title game matchup with Miami here in the Fiesta Bowl on Friday night. The National Collegiate Athletic Association requires the form for an athlete to qualify for emergency money, as Clarett would have needed for a plane ticket to his home in Youngstown, Ohio.   ""They can't lie about that,"" Clarett, a freshman, said defiantly before a throng of reporters at Sun Devil Stadium on media day. ""I won't sit here and let them lie about that."" On Monday, Clarett said university officials first ignored him, then gave him ""the runaround"" when he asked to fly home to attend services for Juaquin A. Bell, who was found fatally shot on Dec. 21. His funeral was Monday. Ohio State's athletic director, Andy Geiger, said that the university would have allowed Clarett to go home but that he had not filled out the proper form. In a statement released tonight, Geiger said Clarett had not submitted the form, Free Application for Federal Student Aid, as of Monday. He said the form, given to all Ohio State student athletes during orientation, requires information on family income from the previous tax year and must be filed annually. ""Maurice may have begun the process,"" Geiger said, ""but at the time we had to make the decision, there was no indication of a Fafsa on file for Maurice. We were therefore compelled to follow the N.C.A.A. rules as they apply to the situation."" At a news conference Monday, Clarett, who set freshman records at the university and helped power the Buckeyes to a 13-0 record, said Ohio State officials cared more about a football game than a loss of life. Geiger disagreed. ""We care deeply about all of our student athletes, and we did everything possible to assist Maurice Clarett in this time of his personal grief,"" Geiger said. ""Unfortunately, given the circumstances, we had no choice other than to react in the manner in which we did."" Clarett said today that he had asked Coach Jim Tressel about going home and that Tressel had referred the matter to the athletic department's compliance section, which reviews any financial aid or benefits given to student-athletes. Clarett, 19, said his mother, Michelle, filled out the form last week and submitted it to the university. She declined to comment today. Clarett did not hide being angry about missing the funeral. He said he was most upset that Heather Lyke Catalano, Ohio State's associate athletic director for compliance, did not contact him after he filed his paperwork. ""The compliance lady said she'd get back to me in my room,"" Clarett said. ""She never called back in my room or on my cellphone. That's the real reason I was mad, because she didn't call me back."" Catalano said she could not comment.  http://www.nytimes.com"
2003-01-02,"Congressman visits, speaks with Grand Valley State U. students",21,"""It's an interesting time in politics, in governments,"" said moderator, Dr. Paul Leidig. The conversation then turned to several issues concerning the American people; some of which where foreign affairs, the Patriot Act, religion in government, taxation, and many others. Congressman Pete Hoekstra was the speaker on these diverse issues as he was on the Grand Valley State University campus Tuesday, November 19. Hoekstra is a native of the Netherlands, but is now living in Holland, Mi. The House of Representatives elected Hoekstra into the house in 1992. He serves on the Intelligence, Budget, and Education Committees. Hoekstra has visited Grand Valley's campus in the past, and was asked to come again by the College Republicans. The event took place at 2:30 pm in the Pere Marquette Room, in Kirkhof. Students filled the chairs as Hoekstra took on the many political issues that we all face. Grand Valley State U. Following Leidig's opening; Hoekstra only took about ten minutes to introduce a few topics that he felt were relevant in politics at this time. He spoke on the ""War on Terrorism"" and how it affects people in Michigan. ""The war on terrorism and the terrorists' attacks on September 11 had a tremendous impact on our economy,"" said Hoekstra. He hopes that with his position on the Intelligence Committee that citizens of Michigan will put more attention toward what is going on in Afghanistan and with the economy. The Budget Committee is also something that Hoekstra serves on and feels is something that people should care more about. Taxes is why we should care more about this committee said Hoekstra. The surplus that the committee has been creating, and hopes to continue creating, will be used to start paying off government debts and if those debts do not get paid then the public will start paying them, through taxes. ""Lots of things going on at the federal level,"" remarked Hoekstra as he passed the floor onto the students for close to an hour of open questions. Foreign affairs were the first topic on people's minds. A two-part question about actions in Iraq and dealings with Saddam provided Hoekstra with some good material to speak on. American planes being shot at over Iraq's no-fly zone was a concern, but Hoekstra assured the audience that Iraq can not hit our planes. America's reason for having planes in the no-fly zone is to ensure that Iraq does not have planes up there. Hoekstra explained that Iraq's missiles are radar guided, but they can not leave their radars on for more than a second because then we will know where they are firing from. Because of that they can not take an accurate shot at our planes. ""There is a possibility they will get lucky which will be a very tragic thing, but the likelihood of them hitting us is very, very low,"" said Hoekstra. The second part of the question pertained to the concern of Iraq being able to hide the materials they are using from our inspectors. Iraq's been hiding stuff for the past five years, since the last inspectors were there, according to Hoekstra. The substances that Iraq is using leaves certain markers or signatures that the inspectors are trained to pick up on, and satellites are monitoring movements in Iraq incase they try to move any large objects. These precautions and ensuring that the inspectors are able to go anywhere they want should cut down the concern of them being able to hide anything. A question about the speed and approach that the Bush administration has been taking with Iraq was asked. Hoekstra agreed with the approach that Bush has taken, and that there is no argument that ""he is going at it alone"", being that we now have support from Sierra and Iran. Along with the foreign affairs topic was a question about North Korea's nuclear capabilities. Hoekstra said that North Korea does not yet have a nuke, but that they could have one within the next 12-18 months, and that they may have the technology to aim and fire it at the U.S. Actions have been taken in stopping shipments of fuel oil to North Korea and putting pressure on them to live up to their agreements of not building nukes, said Hoekstra. Hoekstra's opinion on the affects of the Patriot Act on civil liberties was asked by an audience member. Hoekstra answered, ""I don't think the Patriot Act will really infringe on civil liberties."" The government is trying to update surveillance or spy laws on American citizens to match current technology. The objective is only to be able to watch anyone that may have evidence pointing to them being a terrorist, it is a reasonable extension of new technology such as cell phones and e-mail, said Hoekstra. A long and in-depth conversation about religion in schools and in the government was sparked by another question concerning civil liberties. A Justice in Alabama that must remove a large piece of granite displaying the Ten Commandments influenced this question. ""I think we've gone the wrong way in this whole separation of church and state... America was not founded on the belief that government should be anti-religious,"" answered Hoekstra. He mentioned the House of Representatives, and that fact that when you stand at the front of the house looking out at that the panel and look up there is a picture of Moses, and right behind you will be the words ""In God We Trust"". The house also begins each session with prayer. Being a republican on the House of Representatives, Hoekstra was asked about their taxation agenda for the year. He listed off a short piece of the republicans agenda, which included cutting capitol gains, changing the tax ratio for dividends to be equal to capitol gains, allow for an increase in losses ( for businesses), and taking a look at Bush's tax plan. One aspect that Hoekstra spoke very strongly on was the death tax. ""It's [the death tax] gotta go,"" he said. The death tax takes 60 percent of you own and gives it to the government when you die, because of that the number of privately owned businesses is dropping why publicly owned and run corporations are growing. Once the questions slowed down food was brought in and everyone moved about the room talking with Hoekstra and each other about some continuing issues. (C) 2002 The Lanthorn via U-WIRE"
2003-01-01,"Courtesy aids safety, so mind your driving",22,"Let's change gears this New Year's Day and concoct a set of resolutions unrelated to weight, smoking or exercise. Just this once, take a good long look into the rearview mirror at the driver of your own car, pickup or SUV. Let's resolve to make him or her a better, safer and more courteous driver in 2003. AJC Most of us think we're NASCAR-caliber behind the wheel. That's why we do crazy things --- fly down the freeway at 80 mph while chatting on the cellphone, sipping coffee and munching a doughnut. Not even Richard Petty could do all that without hitting an occasional wall. You don't want to do that, and no one in traffic behind you wants you to, either. Most of us could cut our freeway speeds by 10 percent and not lose more than a couple of minutes in our commute. Nearly all of us would gain by limiting in-vehicle distractions. Ration your mobile cellphone calls to the most urgent, and use a hands-free model. Eat or sip with caution. Make sure hands are always on the wheel. The Perimeter isn't Talledega, and NASCAR-style tailgating will get you in a pileup --- maybe not today, but inevitably. And there's a reason the car doing the hitting almost always is charged in a crash. It's called ""following too closely."" Resolve to show consideration for fellow drivers. Cruising in the left lane more slowly than prevailing traffic angers people behind you and is a proven cause of road rage and crashes caused by weaving. Yielding to faster traffic, which is the custom in Europe and elsewhere where driver training is emphasized, would curb tailgating and facilitate traffic flow. Go even further and resolve to take no action on the freeway that forces another driver to brake. You need more than a gap in order to squeeze into a lane. You also need to make sure no one is overtaking that gap. Pull in behind a vehicle and brake instead of jumping in front of it and slowing. Resolve to show more patience at backed-up freeway ramps. Your time is no more valuable than that of the drivers beside you. You have no right to go to the front and force your way in, adding to the delay. If you cross a solid line --- or gore --- in the process, you are violating the law. Resolve to make yourself more visible on the roadway. Not all of us have your perfect 20/20 vision, and we'd greatly appreciate it if you'd use your headlights at dawn, dusk or in the rain. And please note that a lot of newer vehicles with ""automatic"" headlights are in stealth mode from the rear --- no taillights are burning unless you physically turn them on. Courtesy is unbelievably contagious, and you'd be surprised how doing a good deed in traffic can make you feel. When someone signals to change lanes, let them. Don't speed up to block them. Likewise, in gridlocked traffic, let someone else in. And when you are the beneficiary of a good deed, acknowledge it with a friendly wave. Ignoring courtesy tends to make it disappear. Obey the speed limit in residential areas and school zones. Honor the rights of bicyclists and pedestrians. Make a mistake involving another car and you usually have a fender bender and an insurance hassle. Make one with a biker or a walker and it's often a funeral. And by all means, always wear your seat belt and don't drink and drive. Only morons ride unprotected or willingly endanger lives. You're smarter than that. traffic@ajc.com "
2003-01-03,"Drivers face lots of distractions",23,"Dear sir: Why I think cellphones should not be entirely banned in automobiles: The claim made is that the cellphone distracts the driver and can contribute to accidents. I agree that taking one hand off the wheel to dial up and talk on the cellphone can take the driver's focus off the road long enough under the right circumstances to perhaps cause one to become involved in an accident. To alleviate this, I believe a hands-free cellphone or some similar technology is the answer. While some people would argue that hands-free cellphones also take focus off the road, I don't believe a hands-free phone takes any more focus off the road than inserting a CD or a tape into the player and listening to it, or the distraction of listening to passengers and talking to them. How many mothers and fathers have leaned over to deal with distracting young children in their cars, thereby losing focus on the road? Are we to ban CDs, tapes and passengers, especially small children, from automobiles because of their distracting influences? How many accidents are caused by these other three distractions? Let's get real. While steps need to be taken in dealing with cellphone use in automobiles, let's not go overboard. Norm Laing Prince George"
2003-01-02,"Execution Opponent Joins Sniper Case  - Correction Appended",24,"Prof. Roger D. Groot does not mind being unpopular.  Professor Groot has been a thorn in the side of prosecutors and prison officials in this law-and-order state for decades. Early in his career as a law professor at Washington and Lee University, he advocated for the rights of inmates and immigrant detainees. About four years ago, he decided to take on the death penalty here, in the state that has executed more people than any other except Texas since 1976.   Last week, Professor Groot announced that he and several students at the Virginia Capital Case Clearinghouse, a student-led legal-aid clinic at the law school, were joining the defense team of Lee Malvo, 17, a Jamaican who has been charged with murder in the Washington-region sniper attacks.  ""It's never been about being popular,"" said the balding professor who looks like a lawyer from central casting. Mr. Malvo will not be the easiest defendant to represent, Professor Groot conceded. He is charged in one of the most prominent mass murders in recent history and happens to be black, which studies show makes him theoretically more likely to receive a death sentence on conviction. But Professor Groot said he and the students at the clearinghouse, which was created soon after the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, were up to the challenge. He said he took over the program because he opposed the death penalty, which he has denounced as something that allows Americans to ""destroy our own humanity."" ""I oppose the death penalty in all circumstances,"" he said, ""and I think it is counterproductive both morally and practically."" Professor Groot said he became troubled early in his career by how the death penalty was carried out. ""I came to understand,"" he said, ""that the death penalty is almost random in terms of who is selected to be tried, depending on race, the views of the local prosecutor or an election campaign.""  Virginia has executed 87 people since 1976, and it is among the few states that lets juveniles face execution. Even in this staunchly pro-death-penalty state, opponents of capital punishment were making headway after Earl Washington Jr., who is black, was spared death 11 hours before his execution in 1994 after DNA evidence suggested that he was not the killer. Mr. Washington was freed in February, and his case became a rallying cry among those who say black men are often sentenced to death with insufficient evidence. But such questions have died down since the arrests of Mr. Malvo and the other sniper suspect, John Muhammad. Thirteen people were killed in the attacks, which occurred in October.  The decision to help Mr. Malvo's case was made after Mr. Malvo's lead lawyer, Michael S. Arif, had approached Professor Groot at a conference in Richmond. It had been a bad couple of weeks for Mr. Arif. Immediately after the arrests, politicians and prosecutors began calling for the death penalty. Attorney General John Ashcroft said Mr. Malvo deserved what he called ""the ultimate sanction,"" and aides say he handed both men to prosecutors in Virginia because he believed that is where a death sentence could be obtained most quickly. Virginia's state and federal appellate courts are also considered difficult locales to overturn a capital conviction. After the move, detectives in Fairfax questioned Mr. Malvo without lawyers present, arguing that after he had been transferred federal public defenders no longer represented him, and refused a request from his court-appointed guardian to halt the questioning.  Investigators say that in the questioning Mr. Malvo confessed to at least three shootings, including the one for which he faces a murder trial in Fairfax, the killing of a woman on Oct. 14 outside a Home Depot hardware store in Falls Church. The defense team did not win any court motions in November and said it felt hampered by state rules that require a judge's decision on paying all expenses for indigent defendants. The defense also said it was dwarfed by the size of the prosecution team.  When Mr. Arif asked Professor Groot for help, the odds and the clamor for convicting and executing Mr. Malvo made it a simple decision, Professor Groot said.  The two law students whom he selected to work on the case are Lee Goebes and Ida-Gaye Warburton. Mr. Goebes is a third-year law student. Ms. Warburton, a second-year student, is from Jamaica, like Mr. Malvo. Other students in the program are helping with 26 additional cases.  Professor Groot said he and the students only helped at trials, and not on appeals, because ""in Virginia, if you get a capital sentence, we push paper around for a couple of years and then we kill you.""  Successful appeals in Virginia are so rare, he said, that a trial ""is how you avoid a death sentence."" http://www.nytimes.com Correction CORRECTING THE RECORD; The Articles; Witnesses and Documents Unveil Deceptions In a Reporter's Work On Sunday, May 11, 2003, The Times published a two-full-page accounting of misrepresentations and plagiarism by Jayson Blair, who resigned on May 1 as a reporter.

2003-01-02,"Family still searching for missing Cedar Grove woman",25,"susanwilliams@wvgazette.com  As the year came to an end, Angie Upton was busy thinking of ways she can keep her niece's memory alive. Nine months ago, Bonnie Lueann Woods-Cale left her home in Cedar Grove to go to Tucker County. Upton has not seen or heard from her since. Cale made it to Tucker County and left her son with her estranged husband who lives there. The 9-year-old boy is now with his father, Upton said. Cale's vehicle was found in Webster County. Because the case spanned three counties, State Police took over supervision of the case in September. Her estranged husband does not have a telephone, and a message left with his mother brought no response. Upton feared her niece was dead from the beginning. She put up posters and started a campaign to alert members of the media about her niece. ""I call police at least three times a week,"" Upton said. ""I'm afraid if I let go, they will let go."" Her previous efforts proved fruitless. ""I was just sitting here thinking what could I do next,"" she said from her home. She was also working on a new flier to distribute. Cale was 28 when she disappeared. Her birthday was July 1. In Webster County, police found the Chevrolet Blazer she had been driving. It had a pair of jeans and a coffee cup that belonged to Cale in it. Contacted Tuesday, members of the Webster County Sheriff's Department had nothing new to report. Upton said most recently she has been in contact with a state trooper who works for the Bureau of Criminal Investigations, but he is off for the holidays. Cale had two cell phones when she left Kanawha County to go to Tucker County. No one has received a call from Cale since she left nine months ago, Upton said. Upton said the police and prosecutors she talks to seem stymied. ""Basically, they need to find her,"" she said. Cale planned to leave her 9-year-old boy with his father in Tucker County while she drove on to visit her parents. Her parents haven't heard from her since. The father of the 9-year-old has told people he thinks she took off, Upton said. ""If he thinks she just took off, what's the big deal about him taking a lie detector test?"" Upton is in the process of contacting newspapers in Webster and Tucker counties. ""I just don't know what else to do. There's somebody out there who knows something,"" she said.

2003-01-02,"Festive fines for thousands in the post",26,"The New Year hangover will arrive in the post for thousands of people arrested over the festive season. In the North Island more than 780 revellers were arrested on New Year's Eve, mainly for breaching liquor bans and disorderly behaviour in Whangamata, Mt Maunganui and Auckland. They will be fined between $ 150 and $ 400. But most will avoid their day in court, and plead guilty by letter. Sergeant Vince Ranger, of Whangamata, said a special court day in Waihi had been scheduled for January 7 to deal with the 135 partygoers arrested at the Coromandel resort over the past two days. Most would sign a form to plead guilty, and receive their fine in the mail, Mr Ranger said. Police had not been left with a mountain of alcohol, despite the hundreds of people who had alcohol confiscated after breaching liquor bans that are in place throughout most of the North Island. All confiscated alcohol was poured out, Mr Ranger said. New Year celebrations posed few problems for police. In Hamilton 29 people were arrested. Police said it was a quiet night, with no public countdown to welcome in the New Year. Only one person was arrested for breaching the liquor ban which was introduced late last year. In Taupo, 24 people were arrested on New Year's Eve, while Mt Maunganui police arrested 188 and said the night was a success. Meanwhile, Vodafone has apologised to thousands of customers who have been without cellphone coverage in Bay of Plenty and Coromandel areas for two days. The problem was expected to be resolved by the end of today, spokeswoman Sarah Williams said. Vodafone was considering offering a compensation package to customers affected by the problem, she said. - Police are looking for a man who sexually violated a 16-year-old boy on the sand dunes at Whangamata Beach Access Six about 2am on New Year's Day. The man they are looking for is described as caucasian and aged in his 50s. - An explosion severely damaged a Whangamata pay phonebox about 12.20am today. Police say a group of young people ran from the area just before an explosive device was let off."
2003-01-02,"First night a wild one for police",27,"New Year's Eve was a zoo in Greater Victoria. A cell phone was mistaken for a handgun. Drunks filled up the Victoria and Saanich police cells and spilled over into the sheriff's cells at the Victoria courthouse. There were assaults, knife calls, fights between loved ones and not-so-loved ones. And the madness didn't end at midnight. Times Colonist, with files from Emily Bowers A Central Saanich woman was arrested for impaired driving after a breathalyser test showed she had a blood alcohol level of more than three times the legal limit of 0.08. She was on her way to work and was pulled over on the Patricia Bay Highway at 6:45 a.m. ""She'd been drinking the night before and thought she was fine,"" said Saanich police Sgt. Ed Illi. Saanich police had a wild night, said Illi. They handled 500 calls. Of those, 199 were emergency calls. ""Our cells were at double capacity. We had 12 people in custody, some for intoxication, some for assault and one for a stolen car,"" Illi said. Just before midnight, an intoxicated teenager threatened a bus driver with a piece of glass before getting off the bus in the 500-block of Gorge Road West. In Victoria, a man walking along Yates Street was taken down by police at gunpoint and searched after someone called 911 to report a man walking along the street with a gun. ""We later determined it was a cellphone tucked into his waistband that someone had mistaken for a gun,"" said Sgt. Del Manak. Police also defused five situations where people were threatening to hurt either themselves or others with a knife. Victoria police arrested 53 people for being intoxicated in a public place. ""All the cells were doubled up. Each cell had two people in it,"" said Manak. Revellers started drinking early, but most did not end up in cells. Police told the friends of intoxicated people to take them home and look after them. ""We had to pick and choose who to bring into custody,"" said Manak. Oak Bay police arrested a few teenagers who were stumbling down Oak Bay Avenue after leaving a house party. West Shore RCMP ended the evening with seven people in custody, said Cpl. Jack Gallup. They were occupied with mostly alcohol-related calls, but at 4 a.m. on Strathmore Road in Langford, a car stolen from Nanaimo was set on fire. Police have no suspects. It was much of the same farther up the Island. Mounties in Nanaimo took 51 people into custody. The city's downtown celebration went smoothly, said Staff Sgt. Bruce Wylie. But officers, including an extra 15 on duty, were kept busy with calls to bars and house parties for complaints of noise and public drunkenness. In Campbell River, 18 people were arrested.

2003-01-02,"For the Gadget Universe, a Common Tongue",29,"IT is too soon to describe the Bose family as an audio-world version of the Bush and Kennedy clans in politics, but they are off to a good start.  In 1964, Amar Bose, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and inventor, created the renowned high-fidelity sound systems company that bears the family name. Now, his only son, Vanu, is gaining recognition for radio-design technology every bit as novel as the sound systems that his father pioneered.   The younger Bose's four-year old company, Vanu Inc., is a prominent innovator in the effort to use software rather than hardware to control how radios, cellphones and all other wireless communications devices recognize and manage signals. Early versions of the technology, known as software-defined radio, are beginning to be deployed in military communications equipment and cellular base stations.  The goal is to develop software and related components that recognize various wave forms at any frequency in the radio spectrum and choose the appropriate applications to process them. A single device could provide cellphone service no matter what the format or frequency, exchange wireless messages with laptop or hand-held computers, and communicate with walkietalkies or emergency services.  There is another potential benefit: being able to incorporate improved data speeds and features simply by downloading software, rather than replacing the customer's hardware or the companys network equipment.   ""Why build a system to do one thing when you can build it with software to do many things and be upgradable to boot?"" Mr. Bose said.  It is easier said than done. Software radio needs better antennas, advances in the chips that convert radio waves into digital streams of data and methods for using less power, among other things. But software radios potential is so staggering that many experts say its spread over the next decade is inevitable.  Software-defined devices are too power hungry to make them practical for handheld applications now, but eventually consumers will be offered cellphones that jump among the worlds competing signal standards depending on which gives them the best performance or price wherever they happen to be. Unlike today's dual-mode cellphones, which are essentially two separate phones inside a single case accompanied by software that recognizes which one to turn on, true software phones would use the same hardware to interact with the incompatible networks.  Not only would a software phone have fewer components and, presumably, cost less to build, but it would also be easily reprogrammed to take advantage of improvements in the network. Consumers would not face decisions as they do today about whether to buy new phones to take advantage of advanced networks. Instead of facing vast, high-risk technology transitions once a decade, the cellphone industry could advance at a steadier pace, like the personal computer industry.  But there are more compelling uses for software radio technology that have drawn innovators like Mr. Bose and giant companies like Motorola and Boeing into the field.  The Defense Department in particular is counting on the technology to end the dangerous confusion that arises when different branches of the armed forces try to talk to each other, get data from satellites or control robotic weaponry with incompatible communications systems. Despite more than two decades of research and development, experts say, soldiers in combat often carry separate radio systems one to talk to one another and another to communicate with air support.  Similar barriers plague police, fire and rescue agencies, many of which intentionally bought incompatible radio systems to minimize interference with one another. But after Sept. 11, many are looking to software radio technology to give them the flexibility to bridge incompatible systems when coordination becomes critical.  More recently, the Federal Communications Commission has singled out software radio as a possible means for expanding use of the radio spectrum while reducing interference in the most crowded portions. Such devices could, in theory, start a phone call in the portion of the spectrum currently assigned to cellphones and jump temporarily into unused parts of the television or public safety spectrum if more space was available there.  Mr. Bose's background and his enthusiasm as he shows off his prototypes make it hard to believe he ever considered doing anything with his life besides playing around with signals.  Now 37, he recalls being delighted at his opportunities as a child to visit the Bose research labs. As an undergraduate at M.I.T., he plunged into the world of FM radio signals while typesetting a research paper for his father (on FM radio reception when signals arrive at different times after bouncing off various obstructions). ""  That solidified my interest in the field and the math behind it, Mr. Bose said. I always felt I could figure it out if I sat down and worked hard enough on it.""  But Amar Bose never pushed his son to do anything related to the family business, and Vanu Bose appeared for a time to be heading in quite a different direction. He did his initial graduate research on the design of skin patches as an alternative to needles or pills for delivering medicine. Coming on the heels of a two-year stint working with Project Orbis, which flies an eye-care hospital in a DC-10 to impoverished regions of the world, Mr. Bose's research focus pointed toward a career in medical technology.  He was lured back into the signal processing fold by David Tennenhouse, a professor who hired him as a teaching assistant and then persuaded him to lead a software radio study financed by the Defense Department. The four-year project produced an experimental software radio format called Spectrum Ware, a Ph.D. for Mr. Bose and the core technology used to found his company.  The company's first notable product, quite unintentionally, was a battle with M.I.T. over property rights to the technology he invented as a student. The university wanted $1.25 million over eight years in licensing fees, assorted royalties ranging from 4 percent to 10 percent on software and hardware products Mr. Bose might develop, and a 6 percent ownership stake.  It was an impossible demand for Mr. Bose, who wanted to follow his father's example of investing heavily in research and avoiding becoming beholden to venture capitalists out for quick profits.  Vanu Bose eventually worked out a compromise with the university, and these days his energies are focused on software radio's future and his company's place in it. In a field that includes giants like Motorola and L. M. Ericsson and startups like AirNet and QuickSilver, Vanu stands out as the company most committed to designing systems that use common processors, open-source products like the Linux operating system and reusable chunks of software.  ""Vanu has got a unique approach,"" said Allan Margulies, chief operating officer of the SDR Forum, a trade group for companies trying to develop standards and regulations to support the spread of software-defined radio.  Relying heavily on such general-purpose building blocks sacrifices some of the performance benefits of using specialized chips and programs. It has also allowed others using more specialized components to get to market faster with products that fulfill some of software-defined radios potential. But the goal is to position Vanu and the companies that license its software to ride the coattails of the huge investments that companies like Intel and Advanced MicroDevices make each year to improve general processors.  ""Moore's Law is working for us,"" Mr. Bose said, referring to the observation that the general cost of processing tends to fall by 50 percent every 18 months.  If the strategy works, devices incorporating Vanu software will be upgraded more often and more easily than those of other software radio designers. That in turn could accelerate the speed at which software radio technology becomes inexpensive enough to be embedded in most radio devices.  ""They are the first people to really push software radio commercially,"" said Eric Blossom, head of the GNU Radio Project, which is coordinating efforts by programmers and systems developers to develop software radio devices using completely unpatented and freely shared technology.  So far, the pushing has netted Vanu and its 25 employees researchand- development contracts, including some with Bose to use Vanu technology for projects unrelated to software radio. The company was also part of a team led by Boeing working on an early stage of the Joint Tactical Radio System project, the Defense Department's effort to develop a software radio strategy for the armed forces.  But other startups are further along commercially. AirNet, for example, has sold systems enabling overseas phone companies to switch to higher-speed signal formats without having to install new equipment at every base station; instead, customers will simply download software from a central office.  Mr. Bose said his company expected to conclude new licensing and consulting deals by this spring.   ""Getting their first major sale is their critical challenge,"" said Peter Cook, a former Motorola scientist in Phoenix who has become a wellknown software radio consultant. ""Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia -- the equipment companies who could pick this stuff up and run with it -- have been following developments but are reluctant to jump in because they make a lot of money selling maintenance to todays base stations. If a company like Vanu can break through with one big customer, the market could come tumbling after them."" http://www.nytimes.com Graphic   Photos: THE VANGUARD -- A prototype device designed to utilize Vanu software radio technology. (Jodi Hilton for The New York Times)(pg. G6); NEW LANGUAGE -- Vanu Bose at his office in Cambridge, Mass. Software will increasingly let disparate devices communicate, he says, and make them easily upgradable. (Jodi Hilton for The New York Times)(pg. G1) Chart: ""Conquering Babel""Each wireless device, like your cellphone, cordless home phone, walkie-talkie or baby monitor, is designed to have processing for a specific frequency band and technical standard, limiting it to communicating with like devices. The field of software-defined radio, including the form being advanced by Vanu Bose, aims to put the processing burden on easily modified software, providing many potential advantages. UPGRADES -- When more advanced systems reach the market, like new generations of cellular technology, consumers and wireless-service providers often have to replace their hardware. In a software-defined system, software can simply be modified, enabling faster, cheaper upgrades. COMPATIBILITY -- Devices operating on different frequencies or standards -- like an 800-megahertz digital police radio and a firefighters' analog radio in the VHF band -- are unable to communicate. At an emergency scene, a mobile base station with special software could receive the police transmission and resend it as an analog VHF signal. (Source: Vanu Inc.)(pg. G6)"
2003-01-03,"FOR THE RECORD",30,"QUAKE HITS WEBER An earthquake shook Weber County late Thursday, but caused no reported injuries. The quake, with an epicenter just north of Huntsville, registered a 3.7 on the Richter scale, according to preliminary reports from the University of Utah Seismography Station. Police dispatchers fielded more than 200 calls from throughout the county about the small quake, but received no reports of injuries or property damage. HIKERS RESCUED  Two 18-year-olds were rescued from the peak of Mount Ben Lomond on Wednesday after becoming separated during a storm the day before. Spencer Grimley and Phillip Burnett had traveled up the mountain on Monday, said Weber County Sheriff's Lt. Jeff Malan. After the two became separated Tuesday, Grimley used his cell phone to call his father, who notified authorities. The search was called off about 11 p.m. Tuesday due to high winds and low visibility. A Department of Public Safety helicopter picked up the youths early Wednesday. Both teenagers had supplies, Malan said, and each had dug a snow cave and huddled in sleeping bags. Grimley was fine, Malan said, and Burnett was treated for exposure at an Ogden hospital. HOMICIDE CHARGE  A 45-year-old transient was charged Wednesday with killing another man by pushing him onto rocks near the Jordan River Bridge on Dec. 28, causing a head injury. Prosecutors charged Gary Allen Sears with homicide by assault, a third-degree felony, in the death of Anthony Ray Mondragon, 46. Witnesses told authorities they saw Sears push Mondragon, also a transient, to the ground near the Salt Lake City bridge. Mondragon never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead a day later. A medical examiner's report concluded the cause of death was a closed head injury. Sears is in the Salt Lake County Jail on $ 50,000 bond. He faces up to 5 years in prison. ANIMAL ASSAULT  A Salt Lake City man is facing felony charges for allegedly striking a puppy with a baseball bat and threatening the dog's owner. Joseph Ryan Elmore, 22, was charged Wednesday with aggravated assault, a third-degree felony, and Class B misdemeanor cruelty to animals stemming from the incident Dec. 20. MAN STABBED A 22-year-old Park City man is in critical condition after being stabbed early Wednesday. Rigoberto Rodriquez Morales was stabbed in the chest, right side and right hand by an acquaintance at about 4 p.m. in the Snow Country Condominium complex, 1150 Deer Valley Drive, according to a police report. The 24-year-old suspect is being held in Summit County Jail. Police found a weapon at the scene. Officers did not release the motive for the stabbing."
2003-01-01,"FRIENDLY COMPETITION;FORMER SCHOOLMATES TAKE DIFFERENT PATHS TO RESTAURANT WORLD",31,"At a table in the St. Christopher's School cafeteria, Chris Schlesinger and Steve Johnson forged a friendship that took them to picnics, pig roasts and beach parties at Sandbridge. Nearly 30 years later, they still meet for meals - but they are more likely to eat Schlesinger's chili-glazed jumbo shrimp or Johnson's five spice-smoked spareribs with ginger, soy and sesame. Each one has become an award-winning chef and restaurateur in the Boston area. Though they own competing restaurants in Cambridge, Mass., they are such good friends that Schlesinger knows Johnson's home, restaurant and cell phone numbers by heart. When they get together, they might tease each other about inhaling Jell-O years ago, but more than likely, they talk shop. With his animated gestures and easy laugh, Schlesinger is a natural raconteur. Johnson, a former French language and literature major who lived in France for a few years, is more reflective but equally articulate. Both are somewhat amazed to find themselves at the forefront of one of the nation's most vibrant restaurant scenes outside of New York and San Francisco. Their Southern accents may have faded, but both are still influenced by their Virginia roots. Both chefs have become well-known through their restaurants, as well as their appearances at Boston charity events. ""Both Chris and Steve have really helped mold Boston's cuisine scene. They both have a strong sense of who they are as restaurateurs and chefs,"" said Ellen Albertson, co-host with her husband of ""The Cooking Couple"" show, a popular Boston radio program about food. ""Chris has been a major force in mentoring many chefs who have gone on to open their own successful restaurants. Steve has been a pioneer in the area of world cuisine."" Neither imagined becoming a professional chef when he graduated from St. Christopher's in 1974. ""A chef was not the proper career path to choose,"" said Schlesinger, whose extended family includes Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Chris' only hint of his future career was the Kool-Aid stand he set up one summer on Duke of Gloucester Street in Williamsburg, where he grew up. ""I guess my entrepreneurial spirit was strong, because I had three kids working for me. One day, we made $300."" When officials shut down the stand, Schlesinger posed in the stocks for a picture in the local newspaper. After dropping out of college, Schlesinger started restaurant work by chance when his grandmother told him of an opening at Blue Petes, a fried seafood emporium in Virginia Beach, near the family's vacation house. He started washing dishes, and, to his surprise, thrived in the fast-paced atmosphere. ""What drove me then, and still does today, is that I love being in the kitchen,"" he said. He eventually went on to earn a degree from the Culinary Institute of America. After traveling and surfing around the world, Schlesinger settled in Boston, opening The East Coast Grill and Raw Bar in 1985. The window is playfully decorated with neon red flames and a blue cocktail glass. The menu - mostly grilled foods with bold flavors, emphasizing locally caught seafood - is written on a chalkboard. In 1996, the James Beard Foundation named Schlesinger Best Chef in the Northeast. Until a few months ago, Schlesinger also owned for several years a second restaurant, The Back Eddy in coastal Westport, Mass. Though Schlesinger spent several years behind the stove, he now lets other chefs cook most nights, while he focuses on running the business and related projects. He has co-authored eight cookbooks and dozens of articles with John Willoughby, now executive editor of Gourmet magazine. Their first book, ""The Thrill of the Grill"" (William Morrow, 1990), has become a classic introduction to barbecue and grill techniques. When the book was first published, Schlesinger sent a copy to his English teacher at St. Christopher's who mistook him for a foreign student because his writing was so clumsy. Schlesinger and Johnson stayed in touch over the years, especially as they both started careers in the food industry. ""Chris was one of the first people I knew to go to cooking school,"" said Johnson, picking up the story. ""It was more mainstream to do as I did. I worked at a restaurant and then took it from there."" ""Yeah,"" Schlesinger said, jokingly. ""You were too busy going to college first."" Johnson's first job was at Grace Place in Richmond, a natural foods restaurant in the Fan that was popular in the 1970s and 1980s. He then became a caterer in Vermont before moving to Boston and working for some of the city's up-and-coming chefs. When Johnson was shopping for a restaurant of his own, by coincidence, Schlesinger was ready to sell The Blue Room, another restaurant he owned. Johnson kept the name, and became chef and co-owner with partners in 1996. He uses a wood grill to create New England-, Mediterranean-, Latin- and Asian-accented dishes with top-of-the-line ingredients. Working closely with a group of chefs who support local agriculture, he makes a point of ordering New England-grown ingredients. In 2001, Boston magazine named him the best chef in the city. On a typical Saturday night, Johnson gracefully glides from dining room to kitchen, his white chef's coat gleaming under halogen lights turned low. The exposed brick walls and bare beams look a bit like a renovated Shockhoe Slip warehouse. He is clearly in his element as he checks in with customers, inspects finished plates and restocks supplies as cooks bustle in the restaurant's open kitchen. ""Running one restaurant really well is what I want to be doing,"" he said. ""It's the old-school mentality. You open the doors, make the customers happy, then you go home."" Both chefs still draw on the flavors of Virginia and the South. The East Coast Grill offers Tidewater coleslaw, buttermilk-fried oysters and oak-smoked pit barbecue platters. In season, Johnson makes sauteed Virginia striped bass, serving it with haricots verts and a fennel risotto. He also pairs grilled sirloin with mashed sweet potatoes and collard greens. Schlesinger pointed out that the Southern way of life has helped him, too. ""I was brought up to be polite and courteous. It has unintentionally contributed to my success in hospitality. I built a reputation as one of the friendliest and most polite restaurants in the city."" Johnson added with a smile, ""I still catch myself saying 'Yes, ma'am' and 'Yes, sir.'"" Johnson also says his experiences during the first years of busing at Huguenot High School, before he attended St. Christopher's, help him manage a diverse kitchen staff. ""I learned to get along with all kinds of people in the public schools. That's important because so many people on my kitchen staff are Hispanic. I speak more Spanish - badly - than French now,"" he said. Schlesinger said his Westport restaurant, on the coast several miles west of Cape Cod, reminded him of Virginia Beach and Tidewater. ""I guess all my life, I've been trying to get back to that very first job at Blue Petes."" Chris Schlesinger's Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Roasted Corn-Bacon Relish  Makes 4 main-course servings. Relish:  3 ears corn, shucked  4 tablespoons maple syrup  3 slices bacon, diced small  1 large yellow onion, diced small  1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage  Salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste Pork:  3 10- to 12-ounce pork tenderloins  Salt AND freshly cracked black pepper to taste Relish: Cook the corn in boiling water for 4 minutes. Remove it and allow to cool to room temperature. Over a medium fire, grill the corn 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly brown. Brush on the maple syrup and continue to grill for 2 to 3 minutes longer, or until the syrup begins to caramelize (it will turn golden brown). Remove the corn from the grill and let cool. With a sharp knife, remove the kernels from the cob. In a saute pan, cook the bacon over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the onion and cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until the onion is translucent. Add the corn and cook 2 minutes longer. Remove the corn mixture from the heat, add the sage, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir well and set aside. Pork: Rub the tenderloins with salt and pepper to taste, and grill over a medium fire for 12 to 15 minutes, rolling them every 3 to 4 minutes to ensure even cooking. (I prefer to eat this cut slightly pink, but if you like yours cooked completely, leave it on 4 to 5 minutes longer). Remove the tenderloins from the grill, allow them to stand for 5 minutes, then carve each into 1/2-inch slices. Spoon some relish over each portion of the sliced pork and serve.

2003-01-01,"FUTURE TO REINFORCE TIES TO PAST",32,"William Clark and Meriwether Lewis could, at least, stop and ask for directions. Sure, they were trekking into uncharted territory. But a lot of people were there ahead of them, able to tell Lewis and Clark what was around the next turn as their Corps of Discovery followed the Columbia River toward the Pacific Ocean. Today we head into really uncharted territory, and nobody got there before us: We take our first step into 2003. The route isn't totally unknown, however. Some of the paths we followed through 2002 will continue into the new year, and beyond. Fittingly enough, they include the saga of Meriwether and William. Vancouver's three-year observance of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial will begin with an artistic flourish in February. That's when New York artist Maya Lin, designer of the nation's Vietnam Veterans Memorial, is to deliver drawings of two works of art for Vancouver: a bridge over state Highway 14 from Fort Vancouver to the Columbia River and a landscape design at Blurock's Landing near Frenchman's Bar. Vancouver's first bicentennial display, ""End of Our Journey,"" will open May 8 at the O.O. Howard House on the Vancouver National Historic Reserve. City on the move Vancouver may be on a journey of its own over the next few years, marching out into unincorporated areas as it expands its city limits. As county commissioners decide whether to push out urban growth boundaries for local cities, Vancouver's top priority is to push the line right to Camas' city limits. Vancouver would like to see its urban growth boundary expanded by about 12 square miles to allow for more industrial and commercial development. Camas also is keenly interested in someday annexing the Fisher's Swale area between the two cities. That outward march of city limits will be part of updating the 20-year growth plan for this county that bears Clark's name. The county commissioners have projected annual population growth of 1.5 percent in their land-use planning for the next 20 years. They have pledged to preserve and create industrial land to lure family-wage jobs. How many acres they open to housing and commercial development will set growth patterns for years to come. Employment will continue to be a big story in Clark County, after a recent cycle in which high-tech manufacturing companies and telecom employers cut jobs and then cut jobs again. But as some sectors chopped, others -- including health-care employers and retail stores -- have been adding workers. Outlook is brighter Many local business people expect Clark County's economy to pull out of the doldrums in 2003. High-tech businesses tied to the semiconductor industry are expected to make a modest recovery this year as worldwide demand increases for computers, cell phones, digital cameras and a host of other gadgets. Health care will continue to be an economic driver as construction gets started on a new Legacy Health System hospital in Salmon Creek, an expansion at Southwest Washington Medical Center, a new Kaiser Permanente medical office building and a possible expansion by the Vancouver Clinic. Retailing will continue to expand as WinCo, Target, Wal-Mart, Costco and Albertsons bring new stores here. On another construction front, 2003 will be the make-it-or-break-it year for Vancouver's long push to build a downtown convention center. The city must have construction under way by the end of the year or it will lose a state sales tax credit worth more than $ 700,000 a year. The tax credit is considered essential to finance the project. If mortgage interest rates remain low, homebuilding will continue to contribute 10,000 jobs and $ 300 million in capital investment a year to the county's economy. It all should result in improvement in the county's employment picture. Unemployment hit a 15-year high of 9.6 percent in early 2002, then slowly declined to 7.9 percent (14,500 unemployed) in November. Leading the way Leadership has changed since the days when Thomas Jefferson could tell a guy to walk west until he was ankle-deep in saltwater. In Vancouver, six members of the city council will appoint a replacement later this month for Jim Moeller, who was elected to the state House in November and will resign his council seat. It will be the first time the Vancouver council has had to fill a vacancy since September 1990. In the fall, Mayor Royce Pollard is expected to run for a fifth two-year term as mayor. Council members Jeanne Lipton and Dan Tonkovich will be up for re-election. The person appointed to fill Moeller's term also will need to run. Schools will continue to reflect forces affecting the larger community. The state's $ 2 billion budget shortfall hasn't made its way down to local districts yet. But early conversations indicate that recent initiatives approving pay raises for teachers and money for reducing class sizes are in jeopardy. That could mean more crowded classrooms in the future, or cuts in other school programs if districts want to maintain current staffing levels. Demands of the technology-based economy will influence local education as Clark College and Washington State University Vancouver start work on a four-year engineering program. The partnership will answer demands for a four-year college education in an area where the closest four-year public campus The Evergreen State College -- is in Olympia, 110 miles away. Schools also are an indicator of local growth. Camas will open a new high school and the Evergreen School District a new elementary this year to accommodate expanding enrollments. Vancouver will begin work on a new middle school. The school construction also reflects another continuing theme. Vancouver's new school will be named for Thomas Jefferson. Evergreen's elementary will bear the name of York, the slave of William Clark. What's ahead in 2003? * Population growth and an expansion of city limits. * Economic recovery. * New faces in local politics. * State budget to put strain on Clark County schools. * New construction.

2003-01-02,"GMC Sierra in a class of its own",33,"We love trucks in Prince George. We really do. A car is nice. So is an SUV. But a truck will take you places. A truck will carry everything you will ever need. And now with the arrival of hot crew cabs like the limited edition Sierra, you can arrive at your destination in superior style and comfort. You step inside the Sierra and it reaches around, cradles you like a baby. I've never been in a more comfortable truck. Let's talk about the seats. Well, if my rear end could talk it would sing the praises of the wide leather seats. I had three of my friends try out the front and rear seats and this is what they said: ""Wow, these seats kick ---."" ""I can't believe how comfortable and supportive these seats are."" ""I close my eyes and I feel like I'm in a Cadillac."" What makes the seats so wonderful? The leather is soft. They are very adjustable. And they offer a supportive feel in the lumbar area where you need the support the most. They are contoured on the sides, so you don't slide around when you take a corner. There is nothing worse than flat leather seats. The buckets in the Sierra hold you securely. Add in the two settings of seat memory and heat and things start really shaping up. The carbon look accents on the interior of the SLT give it a modern and understated look. The GM designers put some time and effort on the interior of the Sierra. The dual climate controls are easy to use. There is plenty of storage. Cubby holes are rubber lined so things don't slide around. And, of course, the electro-chromatic mirror gives you the option of knowing the compass direction and the temperature. And if that weren't enough, GM put in a wonderful steering wheel, complete with volume, station, and cell phone controls. Other cool features include six-disc CD changer and an optional entertainment package complete with DVD and seven-inch LCD colour monitor. A nice touch is the two headphone plugs for the rear passengers. Now the kids can listen to the tunes while mom and dad cruise in relative silence. On the outside, the Sierra is armed with 16x7 polished aluminum wheels, running boards, special decals, fog lights, tinted glass, and very deluxe remote-controlled, auto-dimming, heated camper mirrors with integral turn signals in the mirror glass. One of the most impressive features of the truck is the heavy duty suspension. Trucks, well, they normally bounce you around quite a bit. But the Sierra employs monotube 36mm shock absorbers which provide increased damping for better handling and towing. I think the coil springs on the half-ton make a huge difference in overall ride quality. GM gives you power-assisted front and rear disc breaks with four-wheel, anti-lock braking and dynamic rear proportioning. I test drove the truck after a light dusting of snow. The truck's transfer case utilizes electronic push-button controls. It handled great. The Vortec 5300 offers plenty of low-end grunt. Off the line the truck was a great pleasure. It gives you a nice little kick. The exhaust roar is wonderfully tuned. This is a nice sounding engine. At highway speed the engine just purrs. No complaints about GM's Vortec engine. None at all. Smart, responsive and powerful, the GMC Sierra combines the strength you demand with the luxury you deserve. This is a bold and stylish truck.

2003-01-01,"Green Bay turns to Glenn",34,"GREEN BAY, Wis. - It doesn't look or sound like Brett Favre is going to have his favorite receiver on the field against the Atlanta Falcons. ""I told Brett, 'If you throw the ball at my chest or down on the ground, I'll play. But anything over my head, I'm sorry, I just won't be able to make those catches,' "" Donald Driver said. ""I'm hoping I'll be OK for Saturday's game, but if not, I know the guys will step up for us."" Driver even had trouble just putting on his shirt Tuesday, his right arm immobile even before he strapped on his shoulder sling. Green Bay's leading receiver will have to make a remarkable recovery to be able to play in the wild-card playoff at Lambeau Field. So, the Packers are counting on the same player they expected to become their top receiver when the season started: Terry Glenn. ""Terry's a guy who has to step up and be the playmaker,"" Offensive Coordinator Tom Rossley said. That's not a role that Glenn has filled much of this year. After wearing out his welcome in New England and getting traded to Green Bay in the offseason, Glenn finished third on the team with 56 catches for 817 yards and two touchdowns. Glenn did pick up the slack Sunday against the New York Jets when Driver left with a bruised shoulder. He finished with five catches for 72 yards, including a laserlike 14-yard touchdown strike from Favre just before halftime of the Packers' demoralizing defeat to the New York Jets that cost them a bye. ""Obviously without Donald in there, Terry is the lone experienced player,"" Coach Mike Sherman said. ""Even Donald's experience is relegated pretty much to this year and sporadic third-down plays in the past. Terry will be relied on for his experience. ""He had a great practice this morning and I expect him to continue to do what he can do to help us win this game."" Glenn, who wasn't in the locker room Tuesday and didn't answer his cell phone, has had just two big games this year: against New Orleans in September (nine catches for 81 yards and a score) and against Chicago in October (eight catches for 154 yards). He has played all year in Driver's shadow as the fourth-year pro from Alcorn State emerged as the Packers' best receiver, leading the team with 70 receptions for 1,064 yards and nine touchdowns. Sherman is holding out hope that Driver will be able to play Saturday, but Rossley is working on the premise that he won't. Favre said he thinks he and Glenn have a good rapport going despite Glenn's lower-than-expected production. ""I'm sure from Terry's standpoint, and I'm guessing, that he would like to be more involved,"" Favre said. ""As a receiver or a skilled guy, you'd like to touch the ball more or see it thrown your way more."" But Favre said Glenn, who had a reputation as a smart player with a bad attitude in New England, has never once griped since his arrival in Green Bay and nobody has ever had to tell him twice how to do something. ""One thing about Terry that people don't know, he has been great to work with, has never complained, is a quiet guy, he knows what's going on,"" Favre said. ""We've never had to worry about whether he lines up in the right place. ""For the most part, when I've thrown it to him, he's caught it. We haven't thrown it to him that much."" That could change Saturday night. If Driver is out, Robert Ferguson will be the split end, rookie Javon Walker the third receiver. Karsten Bailey, who had three receptions this season, would be the fourth receiver. Glenn has been the flanker all year, so nothing changes, except for the Packers' emphasis on him. ""I don't know what's going to happen with Donald, whether or not he's going to play. Either way, Terry has to think that he's going to have a big game,"" Favre said. ""And I'll sling it to him."" n n n The New York Giants signed veteran long-snapper Trey Junkin on Tuesday and placed long-snapper Dan O'Leary on injured reserve with a torn thumb ligament. The signing of the 19-year veteran comes five days before the Giants travel to San Francisco to play the 49ers in an NFC wildcard game. ""I was with him in Arizona,"" Giant Coach Jim Fassel said. ""I have a lot of faith in him. We need a guy with experience to step in and help us right now."" Junkin has played 281 regular season games for Buffalo, Washington, the Raiders, Seattle and Arizona. The 41-year-old has played in four postseason games, one with the Redskins in 1984, one with the Raiders in 1985 and two with the Cardinals in 1998. Junkin has also played tight end and linebacker in his career, though he hasn't caught a pass since 1994. He has been almost exclusively a long snapper for most of his career. He was cut by the Cowboys in training camp. He will be the Giants' third long-snapper this season, following Bob Jones and O'Leary, who was signed to the practice squad on Nov. 27 and added to the active roster three days later. O'Leary was the snapper for the final five games of the regular season."
2003-01-01,"Hard times derail the 'mommy track' for some",35,"As the economy sputters and employers try to do more with less, the much-vaunted ""mommy track"" may be veering off course. In prosperous times, when the labor pool was smaller, employees seeking work/family balance could easily secure part-time work, job sharing and generous leaves. Now, job applicants are a dime a dozen and corporate America is asking everyone to work faster, longer, harder. The result? Parents who have negotiated for fewer hours say they feel under increased pressure to put in more work, causing some to call it quits. ""Maybe it can work when things are booming … but not now,"" said Amy Teschner, 41, of Evanston, Ill. After 20 years in marketing, the mother of two resigned from her part-time position in June. ""In good times, you get raises and stock options and you think, 'This is not the time to walk away.' But in a downturn, it's a little tougher to convince yourself that the trade-offs are worth it. It's simply easier to leave."" An increasing number of workers seem to share her sentiments. The percentage of households with one stay-at-home parent has increased from 38.9 percent in 1995 to 41.3 percent last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That is the highest level in two decades. The change is occurring for a variety of reasons - including layoffs, stagnant wages and the high cost of day care. But experts say the latest wrinkle is less about money than about disillusionment. Almost 25 years after a voluntary reduction in hours was dubbed the mommy track, some are concluding that the lofty goal of balancing work and family is simply not attainable in tougher times. According to a survey by the New York-based research firm Catalyst - whose founder, Felice Schwartz, crafted the model for the mommy track - more than half of women who downshifted from full time to part time reported that while their paychecks and benefits shrunk, their workloads remained the same. About 10 percent said it increased. ""Instead of part-time employment being the best of both worlds, it may be the worst,"" said Joanne Brundage, founder of Mothers & More, an international nonprofit organization. Officially, corporate America remains as committed to family-friendly policies as ever, said Frank Scanlan of the Society for Human Resource Management. According to a 2002 survey, 64 percent of respondents offer some type of flextime; 37 percent allow telecommuting on a part-time basis and 23 percent have job-sharing. ""We haven't seen any scaling back … but there's no question that people need to be at work to take care of customers,"" Scanlan said. ""You have to strike a balance, but if the company isn't making money, it's all sort of a moot point."" George Davis, a senior vice president at Lincoln Financial Group, appearing before a meeting of human resources executives, put it more succinctly: ""With fewer people to get the job done, the quality of work life has to drop dramatically."" Kate Lauderbaugh, a former vice president for Northern Trust Bank, sees the dilemma from both sides. Having had a colleague who put in two 10-hour days a week, ""I understand the hardship that flextime can impose on co-workers,"" she said. For herself, she reluctantly concluded that management and motherhood were incompatible. Even with an on-site day-care center and a four day week, she still worked 10 hours a day, said Lauderbaugh, who once supervised 65 people and is now home with two children, ages 4 and 14 months. The only solution: Go back to an entry-level position - a move she wasn't willing to make. But that doesn't mean she isn't ambivalent. ""It's been really good for my kids, but I'm not sure it's been great for me."" Meanwhile, the cost of day care keeps climbing while wages have stalled - even more so for women with children, according to the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research. Today's mothers earn about $ 1.50 an hour less than childless women, according to researcher Sarah Avellar, who suggests the reason is that mothers work more part-time hours, which depresses salaries. And now that computers, e-mail, cell phones and pagers have created a porous wall between home and office, everyone is on call all the time - except that those with customized hours are doing it for less. ""If you're not getting high-visibility assignments, not getting raises and have no role models, then it's a job - not a career,"" said Sonia Ossorio, a spokeswoman for Catalyst. ""And that makes the decision to go home much easier."" Few people were tethered to technology more then Cheryl Jakub, a biomedical engineer for Medtronic in Coal Creek Canyon, Colo. When her son was born last year, she negotiated a part-time schedule, but a new project soon interfered. In order to walk out the door at 6 p.m. to relieve the baby-sitter, she would return to her laptop at 10 p.m., when she'd put in another four to six hours. The only advantage: ""I didn't have to get up with the baby,"" she said dryly. (She's now on a one-year leave of absence.) With intensifying demands and dwindling job security, work is more likely to spill over at home, said Diane Wilson, a Chicago job consultant. ""In tough times, people feel that they can't draw boundaries as clearly. And there's no question that those with special arrangements are the hardest to uphold."" Teschner, who had tried just about every possible employment configuration, agrees. Even though she survived two rounds of layoffs and no one suggested she give up her four-day week, the climate had sufficiently changed from the days when talent-starved employers would do ""whatever it takes"" to keep valued staffers, and now ""face time"" has become more important. ""It got to the point where it just wasn't working … and this was the right thing for my family,"" she said. Such decisions usually involve older, better-educated professionals who can still rely on one robust income - a luxury that eludes minimum-wage earners. But quitting comes at a cost for everyone. To pare expenses, Teschner stopped highlighting her hair, swapped bookstores for libraries and limited her clothing purchases to one turtleneck during the last six months. The family is able to get by on the income of Teschner's husband, a self-employed architect, although they both miss the predictability of a steady paycheck. And once her temporary bridge insurance coverage runs out next year, she may need to adjust again. One option: taking a low-level job strictly for health insurance. The quandary is one reason why women start about 65 percent of all new businesses. ""There are lots of variables and there's no one right way to do this. … But in bad times, you'd think people would be clinging to their job,"" Teschner said. ""Instead, it just makes them examine their reasons for working."""
2003-01-01,"Hello, wrong call, IDA",36,"I REFER to the decision by the Infocomm Deve-lopment Authority (IDA) of Singapore to continue the practice of making mobile-phone call receivers subsidise half the cost of mobile-phone callers ('No free incoming cell-phone calls'; ST, Dec 24). This practice is clearly contrary to continuous government exhortations not to subsidise expenditure of a consumption nature. The total cost of making a call from a mobile phone must be borne by the caller, and the caller alone. It is both morally wrong and against natural justice to charge expenses to a consumer for something which he did not initiate, nor has control over. Why should one pay for calls from wrong-number callers, tele-marketers and even associates and friends? IDA's reply that the existing system had 'served Singapore well, with competitive and attractive pricing packages' exposes an unthinking mentality which clings stubbornly to present practices, with little courage to put right what is morally wrong. This despite discovering that 33 out of 40 countries, which presumably include many in the Third World, make callers pay for their calls. As a First World country with one of the highest mobile penetration rates, what justifications do we have to make call receivers subsidise mobile-phone callers? The IDA also did not produce any evidence to support its assertion that many mobile-phone users were under the mistaken impression that changing the format would mean lower telephone bills. It is, however, irrelevant and immaterial whether making only callers pay will increase one's telephone bills. One should only have to pay for one's outgoing calls, instead of subsidising incoming calls. Such a 'pay-as-you-call' approach would be the fairest system. As an agency tasked with gearing Singapore up to meet the information-technology challenge, the IDA should review its archaic and obsolete position of subsidising mobile-phone callers."
2003-01-03,"Holiday-town phone blast 'could have been lethal'",37,"Two teenagers were lucky to escape serious injury when a Whangamata phone booth exploded, sending shards of glass flying across the road. The young women, 16 and 17, were walking past the Telecom payphone opposite the Ocean Rd dairy early yesterday when they noticed something burning inside the booth. Moments later, as they went to cross the road, the burning device exploded, sending glass flying 50m, shattering windows in a nearby car and substantially damaging the stainless-steel booth. Sergeant Vince Ranger of Whangamata police said the explosion was so powerful it blew the booth's door off its hinges and the ceiling into the air. The young women saw a young male running from near the phone booth shortly after the explosion. Police said he might know what kind of device was planted in the booth and they want to speak to him. Lloyd Parker, who lives about 40m from the busy phone booth, was inside his home when he felt the explosion about 12.20am. ""It shook the house, so I went outside. I saw smoke going up and glass was blown everywhere."" Mr Parker said the force of the blast also shattered windows in a car parked outside the phone booth, which has been well used by tourists in the past few days. Many holidaymakers, unable to use their mobiles when the Vodafone network crashed for two days, have queued to use the payphone. A restaurant directly across the road from the booth had just closed for the night, but Ocean Rd was still busy and there was a reasonable amount of foot traffic when the explosion occurred. ""It's lucky it wasn't New Year's Eve,"" said Mr Parker. ""If somebody had been walking past, it would have killed them."" Waihi Detective Sergeant Glenn Tinsley said ""good luck rather than good management"" allowed pedestrians and passing motorists to escape without serious injury. ""I don't believe that this will be the first time this person has tried something like this. It is quite possible that he would have experimented prior to this incident."" Mr Tinsley said it was important to catch the culprit before someone got seriously hurt. All information would be treated with absolute confidentiality. Telecom repairmen were expected to start repairing the damaged booth this morning and hoped to have the phone working again this afternoon. Anyone with information about the explosion should contact the Whangamata police on (07) 865-9111 or Waihi CIB on 027-297-5266. Meanwhile, holidaymakers with cellphones rang through belated New Year greetings from Coromandel and Bay of Plenty resorts yesterday after Vodafone finally fixed its technical problem. The company had battled since midday on New Year's Eve to find what was disrupting its network, as parents fretted over the welfare of teenage revellers whose mobile phones had gone dead. Some coverage was restored on Wednesday night, once teams of technicians worked out how to fix overloaded network management software, and the company said all areas were back to normal by 9am yesterday. Vodafone is now promising to accelerate a coverage improvement programme in both affected regions, including the addition of about 30 cellphone relay sites there over the next year. Spokeswoman Sarah Williams said nobody would have been billed for unsuccessful calls or text messages. But she said compensation for the inconvenience was not possible, because of difficulties identifying customers in the affected areas."
2003-01-02,"How to simplify your work life: Is your workplace clouded by clutter, confusion and chaos? Juliet O'Neill presents a plan for clarity based on a tidy desk, control of e-mail and one-touch paper handling.",38,"How to Simplify Your Life: PART 7 of a special citizen series Dec. 26: How to simplify your life Dec. 27: How to simplify your wife's life Dec. 28: How to simplify your husband's life Dec. 29: How to simplify your kid's life Dec. 30: How to simplify your techno-life DEC. 31: How to simplify your New Year's resolutions JAN. 2: How to simplify your work life Jan. 3: How to simplify your lifestyle Jan. 4: How to simplify your clutter Jan. 5: How to simplify your simplifying - - - How is this relevant to me? If that question grabbed your attention, then work simplification expert Bill Jensen is right about one thing. Never mind (for the moment) the cornucopia of tips on clearing the clutter from your desk, being brutal with e-mail, making ""do"" lists and scheduling meetings just before lunch when everyone's keen to keep it short so they can go eat. Not that Mr. Jensen would diss any of the tried and true methods of smart time management and wise use of technological toys. Even his wife doesn't have the number to his cellphone. ""I use it for outgoing calls only,"" he says. The Ottawa Citizen But he has concluded, during years studying business organizations, that while most of us are tempted to blame technology and other people for the complexity in our work lives, it really has to do with a widespread lack of clarity that plagues management and workforces across North America. Mr. Jensen, the author of Simplicity who heads a New Jersey communications company, the Jensen Group, advises companies to ""compete on clarity."" That's clarity of purpose, goals, organization and communications. In an interview, he singled out the simplifying power of five ""behavioural communications"" questions for which workers -- from top brass to junior support staff -- need the answers to make decisions and get stuff done. (And he recommended the five as a structure for this story as well.) 1. How is this relevant to me? He says this is essential in the ""attention economy"" where people are inundated with too much information. ""We're drinking from fire hoses"" in search of one drop of meaning at work as elsewhere in our lives. 2. What specifically do you want me to do, and how do I get started? In this case, get interested in simplifying your work by reading this story. 3. What does success or failure look like? Your desk will be tidier, your goals more well defined, your priorities staked out, your e-mail less distracting, and your communications so clear that nobody will be left guessing what you need, want them to do or have to offer. You will, as the simplicity buzz phrase goes, ""work smarter, not harder."" 4. What tools and support are available? Checklists, Web sites, day planners, how-to books, seminars, videos, tapes, software or, simplest of all, good old common sense and the comfort of being in good company. 5. What's in it for me or us? Less stress, more accomplishments, more satisfaction, and more free time for your family, friends, and leisure activities. Don't simplify just for the sake of it, Mr. Jensen advises. ""Do it because you're passionate about life,"" he says. The one thing you can't change is the fact there are 1,440 minutes in a day. What you can change is how many of those minutes you can claim ""for what matters most in your life."" If that happens to be your work, that's fine by the way. If your managers and co-workers aren't about to start practising companywide clarity to help simplify your work, you can still take your own steps to reduce clutter, confusion, chaos and careless use of time. One tactic Mr. Jensen recommends is ""blowing off the stupid stuff"" such as e-mailed memos with instructions or queries that contain no time frame or deadlines. ""Go ahead and delete it,"" he says. ""Be militant."" The chances are you'll see that memo again and again before it contains a deadline, making it genuinely important. That's a big key to simplicity: focusing on what's important and not wasting time on the rest. However you decide to simplify your work, it has to be a conscious effort, says Alice Kubicek, an Ottawa-based human resources consultant. ""It's naive for people to think it'll just happen."" For example, many us have heard the golden rule that we shouldn't handle a paper on our desk more than once. The challenge is to actually start doing this. How to do it? The folks at the 123sortit.com Web site recommend a five-basket system with the following labels: to do, to read, to file, today, trash. Simplify that by being totally honest; more paper will wind up in the recycle bin, as might your stack of ""how to organize"" books since you'll be simplified down to this newspaper clipping and some Web sites. The 123sortit.com advisers not only recommend taking before and after pictures when you declutter your desk, but provide step-by-step instructions and testimonials by others about their voyage from the depths of disorder. If you're not sure whether your desk is truly a disaster zone, you can take Canadian time management guru Harold Taylor's ""disorganized desk test"" at www.taylorontime.com/desktest.html. Mr. Taylor has neat formulas for getting things done pronto. One is DASH: Do it. Assign it. Scrap it. Hold it. Be warned that his site is designed to lure you into ordering such ""time management products"" as an $89.95 deluxe leather planner ($69.95 if you skip the planner) or a video tape, How We Waste Our Time/ Set Goals and Priorities, for $195. Or skip the Web test and take this advice: If you can barely see your desk top, have papers overflowing on the floor, often can't find what you're looking for and find people frequently make snide remarks about your work space, well, you know what to do. (Editors excluded.) Ms. Kubicek says her own decision to simplify ""was an unconscious thing"" that happened when she found herself juggling a business and teaching career, a family with two children, and volunteer work in the human resources sector. She didn't want to give any of it up. She moved her consulting work to her home, eliminated commuting time to the office, and got her children, five-year-old Emma and 11-year-old Alexander, to pitch in by becoming more organized themselves -- hanging up their coats when they come in and setting the dinner table -- to free mom's tidy-up time for more fun time with them. Ms. Kubicek has a business phone separate from her personal phone and never gives out her cellphone number. ""I load up my time,"" she adds, with back-to-back meetings and errands scheduled together. And she banks by Internet. ""I really hate waiting,"" she said in an interview. ""I'm very careful how I structure my time."" Her piece de resistance is a briefcase filing system. She keeps the papers for each client of her company, AK Performance Solutions, in a separate brief case. ""So if I am working on a case or running off to a meeting with them, I just grab the appropriate briefcase,"" she said. ""It works all the time."" Once a week, for at least half a day, she devotes to business administration. Her e-mail management is tight: delete all spam on sight and organize e-mail into an instant filing system, so it never gets out of hand and she knows where to find things. Real and virtual desk tops: same rules. She is efficient about requests on her time, pinpointing what's important to her and having the courage to say 'no' when she's reached her limit. ""People respect that,"" she says. In consulting and teaching, she often helps her clients and students simplify a complex task by breaking it down to smaller parts with which they can feel comfortable. ""Often people look for far too complicated an answer to a problem,"" she finds. ""They want to jump to the answer before they understand the situation."" She tries not to work weekends and regards as ""horror stories"" the tales of colleagues who, unable to unplug from their work, take their cellphones and laptops on holidays. ""Leave it at home or switch it off,"" she says. ""Take time for yourself, for your family. Try not to mix business and pleasure. Make that decision and stick to it."" Mr. Taylor, a Newmarket, Ont., author and consultant, isn't so strict on that point. He wrote in a newsletter about how his son was appalled that he checked in at the office daily by e-mail when he went on a holiday cruise last year. Guests on the cruise were allowed a maximum of 15 minutes a day each on the Internet. ""I can only say that after running my own business for 35 years, it's difficult to let go completely,"" he wrote. ""And the 15 minutes of e-mail allowed me the peace of mind that enabled me to enjoy my vacation."" It also showed him how much could get done in only 15 minutes on e-mail. Extolling the joys of brevity, he vowed to discipline himself to short e-mail sessions when he got back to his office. Efficient e-mail management is highly recommended by Susan Ward, a Vancouver businesswoman who runs an excellent Web site on simplifying work, aimed at small business but useful to anybody: http://sbinfocanada.about.com. ""Answering e-mail on demand, or even looking at it, can seriously interfere with whatever other tasks you're trying to accomplish, "" she warns. Ms. Ward recommends turning off your e-mail arrival announcement sounds or symbols and scheduling a specific time each day to handle e-mail -- and not your best time of day when you're most creative or productive. In an interview, Ms. Ward said people who are embarking on simplifying their work should start with small steps, stick to it and get a friend, family member or workmate to help keep you on track, even if it's just an inquiry whether you managed to pull off your goal. If it seems overwhelming, pick one thing, give yourself a deadline and get it done. ""It's like dieting,"" she said. ""You have to follow through with it and get support."" Simple stuff to try: one week without taking personal calls at the office; buy a spare hard drive so you won't be in a panic if yours breaks down; resist forwarding lame e-mail jokes to 10 other busy people; answer all business calls within the same day. If you know you need to simplify, but don't know where to begin, Ms. Ward recommends keeping a record for a while of how you actually spend your work time and you'll see how you're complicating your life or wasting hours. After identifying your problems, set goals for solving them, and a plan and schedule for reaching the goals. Problem: too much time on e-mail. Goal: a limit on e-mail time. Plan: deal with e-mail once a day for one hour at 4 p.m. In your overall work, she recommends writing down your goals, ruthlessly prioritizing your tasks, setting a schedule and sticking to it. And don't waste time waiting: Put it to good use reading a report, planning a meeting or making cellphone calls. Above all, she says, ""know thyself."" Figure out your ""work clock"" -- when you're most productive -- and schedule your activity appropriately. If you work best in the evening, and have the option, work in the evening, for heaven's sake. Ms. Ward does. She works mornings and evenings, taking afternoons for family, exercise and errands. ""I'm a workaholic type myself,"" she admitted. ""I'm the sort of person that even Christmas Day, is checking e-mails to see what's come in. But I've chosen that. You have to adopt the strategies that work for you. It's a myth that you can manage time, but you can manage yourself."" Of course, you could always simplify your work by quitting. But then that would complicate the rest of your life. Graphic   Photo: Hulton, Archive by Getty Images; (How to simplify your work life)"
2003-01-03,"I Smell Pulitzer! (Or Is that Just Sacred Incense?)",39,"To: <>editor@forward.com> From: Larry Yudelson Subject: Proposal for New Series The New York Times recently concluded its 10-part series on the Ten Commandments, with a profile of individuals or institutions illustrating their ""personal struggles to comply with the directions of ancient laws in the modern world, reject them or simply cope with them."" Boffo idea, if you ask me, and real growth potential for a newspaper such as yours. There are, after all, 613 commandments in the Hebrew Bible, leaving open the possibility for almost a dozen years of thumb-sucking human interest stories for an enterprising freelance writer such as myself. By launching the series on, say, Simchat Torah 2003, we can complete it neatly on Shavuot 2015 (or just in time to pay for my youngest's bat mitzvah). I've taken the liberty of outlining a few of the relevant commandments, and the kinds of articles that could illustrate each one. No. 1: Be fruitful and multiply. In a world of soaring overpopulation and surging college tuition costs, Rabbi Yechiel Kornfeld, with 11 children, is surprisingly nonplussed. For this spokesman for a major ultra-Orthodox group, the Malthusian issues matter far less than the imperative to prove his brand of Judaism correct through sheer numbers; an ironic neo-Darwinian imperative from a staunch creationist. No. 110: Don't duplicate the formula of the sacred incense. How does this ancient rule apply today, 2,000 years after God's temple was destroyed? Meet Leo E. Clarke, chief scientist at Generic Labs Inc., torn between the demands of his employers to create a caffeinated cola to be sold under supermarket brands across the country, and the stubborn insistence of the Coca Cola Company to rely on trade secrets, patents and this ancient commandment to keep their formula secret. No. 94: Don't allow idolaters in the land. We find our compelling human-interest story in the consular staff of the Saudi embassy, trying to balance the divine imperative against allowing infidels in the land of the Prophet, while remaining open enough to the modern world to remain, at least on paper, an ally of the United States. No. 321: Thou shalt not work on the eighth day of Sukkot: As commander of New York's fleet of street cleaners, the largest in the Western hemisphere, Joseph Reilly takes his public service so seriously that even on weekends he can be found poring over satellite photos with a magnifying glass, looking for the tell-tale signs of litter that indicate a street left less than spotless. But Reilly finds his staunch Catholicism tested on Shemini Atzeret, Simchat Torah and Idr al Fitr, when work - and alternative side of the street parking - are suspended. No. 169: Thou shalt not allow Levites to inherit part of the land. Itbar al-Yahud is a curious blend of modernity and tradition. Armed with a cell phone, laptop and semi-automatic pistol, al-Yahud is committed to both the principle of 21st-century realty and the ancient laws of God. As head of Re/Max Realtors' Nablus office, he juggles the need to bring in 6% commissions for the Palestinian economy and ensuring that no one possibly descended from the ancient Levite tribe of Israel violates the prohibition of buying land. No. 244: Thou shall not breed a mixture of animals. Josh Ellenson takes this commandment seriously, though he understands it in his own way. ""There is no question that it would be wrong, absolutely wrong, to use recombinant DNA technology to build a new life form, if you were not certain, absolutely certain, that it couldn't return, say, a first-quarter profit of between 21 cents and 23 cents a share on revenue of between $275 million and $290 million,"" says Ellenson, chief ethical officer for Frank N' Genes Research in Princeton, N.J. No. 198: Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister. Yecch, right? But the story of Jeffrey K. (not his real name) and Selma G. (not her real name) of Skokie, Ill. (not their real town or state), offers a tasteful insight into this most ancient of proscriptions. No. 200: Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother's wife. It will take some legwork to illustrate this one, but Jeffrey K. tells me he might have some leads. No. 502: If you are a king, thou shalt not bring yourself excess profit. Anything can happen between now and 2010, but let's just plan on a headline along the lines of ""Something Something Something Dick Cheney."" This list only hints at the possibilities. The animal rights crowd is going to love No. 51, ""The court must judge the damages incurred by a goring ox,"" and I'm already lining up labor lawyers to comment on No. 347, ""Canaanite slaves must work forever unless injured in one of their limbs."" I look forward to your response. If you pass, Kosher Today said they might be interested. Larry Yudelson lives in Teaneck, N.J., where he has been known to keep as many as 10 commandments in a single weekend. "
2003-01-01,"IMMIGRATION NIGHTMARE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF BIGOTRY IN HONG KONG",40," On Friday December 20, my domestic helper and I drove out to Chek Lap Kok airport to meet a Swissair flight arriving from Manila.  My helper was very excited about this, as her two daughters were coming to join us for Christmas. What started out as a joyful event turned into a nightmare thanks to Hong Kong immigration. The plane arrived at 11.08pm. By 12.15am we knew that something was wrong, as the girls had not appeared and the airport was beginning to look very deserted. I went to a Customs officer on the ground level of the arrivals hall to ask if he could help me. He said he could not do anything, but I could pick up a phone across the hall. When I reached it, there was a sign that it was out of order. I then went up to the departures level to try and find a Swissair representative. Perhaps the girls had missed the flight. The departures hall was completely deserted, but a policeman directed me to a Cathay Pacific representative. She went out of her way to find out that the girls had indeed landed in Hong Kong and were being held by immigration. By this time it was 12.45am. The extremely helpful Cathay representative gave me a number to call, and said to try in 10 minutes.  At this point, my helper was frantic with worry, as one of her daughters is only nine. I phoned on my cell phone to immigration, who told me that they were holding the girls. I was then interrogated as to who I was and asked to give my identity card number, which I did. They asked several other questions, both of my helper and me. I asked if they would at least tell us the nature of the problem. No. I asked if their mother could be allowed in with the girls. No. How long would this take? They didn't know. I offered to sign a letter of support or anything else that they felt was required. No. Both of these young people had valid passports and return tickets to the Philippines. In fact, the younger girl had been born here.  Finally, at 1.40am we were told that they would be out in 10 minutes. This stretched out until 2.20am. At last they came through the doors, exhausted and terrified. Merry Christmas.  I would like an explanation, through these columns, from the head of the Immigration Department as to why his officers felt it was in the interests of Hong Kong security to frighten two young girls for almost three hours.

2003-01-02,"Internet users find barriers to sites at school, work, library;Governments, firms, universities and ISPs put up fences. Some do it by design. Others, however, do it unintentionally.",41,"On the Internet, you can learn about virtually anything. You can seek comfort from others similarly afflicted by a rare disease, or explore such sensitive topics as birth control. Just as long as you are not connecting from work, a school or a public library, that is. And if you are using any number of e-mail services that employ junk-mail filters - or a search engine such as Google - do not count on wholly unfettered access, either. As the Internet matures, governments, corporations, universities and service providers are erecting fences, some by design, others often unintentionally. Stop signs, detours, road closures and guarded gateways to exclusive communities went up in 2002 as never before. Jonathan Zittrain, a Harvard University law professor who specializes in the Internet, said he worries that little public discussion attends the construction of these impediments to the free flow of information. ""We could end up with an increasing amount of filtering in the middle without anyone particularly raising much of a hue and cry about what impact it has,"" Zittrain said. Knowledge and innovation are at risk if publishers and researchers must get permission to pass through each gateway, Fred von Lohmann, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco, argues. Consider the World Wide Web. When Tim Berners-Lee designed it in 1990, security firewalls did not exist. He did not have to ask anyone to open up the software communications port used for Web traffic. Today, given the increased risks of viruses and hacking, firewalls seal off unused ports, forcing developers of new services to invent workarounds. Despite extensive technical adjustments, 1 in 5 firewalls continues to pose problems for Net2Phone, which provides cheap long-distance calls over the Internet. And some companies intentionally block PalTalk, an instant-messaging service with audio and video. Other technical obstacles, such as a technique that hides several computers behind a single Internet address, are becoming more common, disrupting online games and other emerging services that need unique addresses, said Fred Baker, chairman of the Internet Society, an organization of Internet architects and professionals. ""It becomes much more difficult nowadays to deploy a new application,"" Baker said. ""It's a very legitimate question whether we would have the Web today if we had firewalls 10 years ago."" Of greater concern to some are fences erected to impose social values. The Internet worked well when intermediary computers did no more than their assigned role of passing data packets along to the next computer closer to the destination, Danny Weitzner of the standards-setting World Wide Web Consortium said. Now those computers, controlled by a multitude of parties, are being increasingly called upon to make social judgments: Is that packet a part of an advertisement, pornography or terrorist communication? Sex education sites, resources on gun control, and online bookstores can get sidelined by mistake or by some policy decision outside the recipient's control. Totalitarian regimes such as China's impose national filters, but even the United States employs such controls. U.S. public schools are required by a disputed law to block pornography if they are to receive federal Internet funding, while many public libraries and companies do it on their own. ""As the Internet has become profitable and boundaries of the Internet expanded, the seamier side and the potential traps have expanded accordingly,"" said Frank Gillman, director of technology at Allen Matkins, a Los Angeles law firm that employs filtering controls. In the last year, Pennsylvania passed a law requiring Internet service providers to block child-pornography sites at the request of prosecutors, giving them powers once limited to the courts. The state Attorney General's Office so far has asked 17 service providers to block 340 sites. The recording industry also briefly tried to compel four service providers to block a Chinese Web site accused of distributing pirated music. It later dropped that lawsuit. Panama's government tried to block Internet-based phone calls, but its Supreme Court later struck down the effort. Meanwhile, the Church of Scientology International used copyright laws to pressure Google to remove listings for a Norwegian site run by critics. The French and German governments cited their laws in getting the search engine to remove hate sites. ""The Internet is not the Wild West, and laws that exist in other media or other forms don't disappear,"" said Dave Baker, vice president of law and public policy at EarthLink, a nationwide Internet service provider. These fences are not always avoidable, their defenders say. Without content filtering in the workplace, employers lose productivity and risk lawsuits if workers access pirated or sexually oriented material, said Harold Kester, chief technology officer at Websense, a maker of filtering software. Likewise, without firewalls, security threats increase, rendering the Internet unusable. The same goes for bandwidth-management tools such as Palisade Systems' PacketHound, which lets networks control how much traffic is permitted for high-volume services such as sharing movies and music. ""When you have certain threats, you give up certain rights to protect against those threats,"" Stephen Brown, Palisade's product marketing manager, said. Some high-speed service providers also employ bandwidth controls aimed at file-sharing systems. Time Warner Cable, for instance, has blocked some users who share large numbers of files and thus degrade the network for others. Notwithstanding the concerns over piracy of copyright materials, when universities restrict file-sharing, students can lose access to hard-to-find documentaries and other material. The fight against junk e-mail also sometimes backfires. Legitimate mail such as newsletters for support groups sometimes gets mistakenly blocked, often without senders or recipients even knowing. Other barriers are possibly on the way, particularly as wireless access proliferates in the coming year. Will the open roads promised by WiFi dominate, or the gated communities favored by cell-phone providers? ""Those battles are just starting to be waged,"" Zittrain, the Harvard law professor, said. ""They could greatly determine just how innovating one can be in that space."""
2003-01-03,"John Grogan / Boob eyes tube while driving",42,"It's 5:20 p.m. on a workday and I am merging onto the Vine Street Expressway into a wall of traffic. In front of me, a Ford Escort that looks like an escapee from the salvage yard weaves like a bee. A weaving car in Philly rush hour? Stop the presses! But this car catches my eye. The passenger compartment emanates an odd blue-gray glow, the kind of otherworldly radiance you might see coming from a spaceship just before aliens emerge and ask to see your leader. (What? You mean, you've never seen this?) The glow gets the best of my curiosity. I slip between two tractor-trailer rigs and pull alongside. This is what I see: A man watching television. Not a passenger watching TV. The driver watching TV. As he merges into traffic. At the height of rush hour. Earth to aliens: Beam him up, please. The TV is not some miniature travel model. It's the real deal, the kind you might have on your kitchen counter. And it's somehow wedged on the dashboard above the center console where it blocks the better part of the windshield. In my commuting adventures, I have seen a lot: drivers shaving, applying makeup, tying ties, reading novels, jotting notes and, of course, gabbing endlessly on cell phones. I've even seen motorists executing several of these multitasking feats of skill simultaneously. But never before have I seen someone turn a car into a mobile multiplex. What? No Raisinets? I'm dying to find out what could be such must-see TV that this upstanding member of the commuting public would risk his life and everyone else's around him to watch. Couldn't he wait till he was in safer surroundings - say, while dismantling explosives back in his garage - to tune in? I pull beside him again and can almost see what's on the screen when - WHOA! Here he comes! I hit the brakes. The truck behind me hits the brakes. The 13,000 commuters behind the truck hit their brakes. And over drifts Mr. Teletubby. No blinker. No warning. No clue. I back off and follow at a safe distance, watching the glowing Escort wind and weave up the Schuylkill and onto the Blue Route. I finally lose him at Plymouth Meeting when he peels off on 276 East toward New Jersey. Where is Tony Soprano when we need him? I never did find out what my pal was watching. But I'm pretty sure he had his own private Ralph and Norton Show unfolding right there in the driver's seat. If he keeps this up, he's sure to get his very own show: Do You Want to Be a Highway Smear? Later, I talk to State Police Trooper Chris Paris at the Belmont Barracks. This can't be legal, can it? Trooper Paris assures me that driving under the influence of reruns is definitely not legal. Specifically, Title 75, Section 4527 of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code prohibits any motor vehicle from having a television mounted ""forward of the back of the driver's seat or otherwise visible to the driver."" ""If I saw that on the road, I'd pull him over and write him a ticket,"" Paris said. Yes! And the fine? A whopping $25 ($100 with costs). Well, it's the thought that counts. Trooper Paris wants to stress that looking away for even a moment - let alone for a half-hour sitcom - can be deadly. And more of us, he says, are looking away - to dial cell phones, to eat Big Macs, and, in my case, to try to figure out what the guy in next car is watching. ""At 55 m.p.h you're traveling 80 feet per second. That's the physics of it. And who drives 55 out there?"" No one I know. Anything else? ""Any task that takes away from the driving is a potentially dangerous one."" OK, trooper, are you about done? ""You are your neighbor's keeper. By driving carelessly, not only do you hazard yourself, but you put everyone else at risk."" So is this guy a complete moron? ""I would say unwise."" Trooper, you're kinder than I am. OK, Mr. Unwise, here's a tip: Next time you hear the boob tube's siren call, do us all a favor. Pull over. John Grogan writes Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

2003-01-02,"Land charges cheat cell phone customers",43,"Like many other students on campus, I have a cell phone. Recently, I received a bill from my wireless phone company for almost three times as much as my usual monthly bill. Upon calling Verizon, I found that certain land phones (such as home phones or business phones) are charging me to call them! Grand Valley State U. This is outrageous! I was charged $ 0.20 per minute plus airtime to call home and many of my friends from home. Please keep in mind, only some land phones are charging cell phone companies, which in turn are charging me. To my disgust, this is perfectly legal also. It does not cost anything to a land phone company for me to call one of their customers, but they still charge me. Sounds a little fishy to me. The only reason I can conclude as to why phone companies would go this low to make up new charges is because cell phones companies are taking over land phone companies. Then I looked at my most recent land phone bill, and for local calling only, it's about $ 30 a month! Sounds like land phones are making a hefty enough profit to me. But wait there's more! The story doesn't end there. I e-mailed some friends to warn them about this new charge, and got some interesting replies. People with Nextels were not charged this new fee, even when they called the same numbers that I was charged the land phone fee for. This is ridiculous. Need I say more? I am being charged to call certain land phones, through my cell phone company, Verizon, when other companies are not charging their customers. For any of you who have dealt with Verizon before, I'm sure you understand how frustrating their billing process is. I have been a Verizon customer for almost 3 years, and have had to call on almost every billing because I've found a problem or had a question. When I called on this last bill, the customer service representative happily erased the charges for me. Once again, sounds a little fishy since Verizon was supposedly charged this outrageous amount by the land phone company of the people I called. Now, with this new land phone charge only being charged to Verizon wireless customers, I'm getting questionable about the company. The company may actually be being charged by land phones, so land phones company managers can still afford their 7 BMW's even with the cell phone business booming and the land phone business declining. This is only my opinion, but with the facts I've gathered, I feel cheated by Verizon. Please check your bills, too. (C) 2002 The Lanthorn via U-WIRE"

2003-01-02,"Markets & Investing; Mild Rebound Is Seen in Initial Stock Offerings Worldwide",45,"COMPANIES like Verizon Wireless and the Guangdong Grid Company of China may help initial public offerings rise worldwide this year as faster economic growth in the United States and Asia increases demand for equity, investors and bankers say.  ""People are more optimistic about economic growth in the U.S. and elsewhere"" this year, ""which makes them more comfortable about buying equity,"" said David Chapman, who helps manage $650 million in global shares at Towry Law Asia in Hong Kong. ""I'm getting ready for increased new issuance over the next 12 months.""   Also, rising stock prices worldwide may encourage more companies to sell shares to the public. Even so, global stock markets and economies are not expected to rebound fast enough to lift initial share sales to the levels seen in 2000. In Europe, initial offerings are unlikely to top the $12.8 billion raised in 2002. The region's biggest initial offering of 2003, the French government's sale of shares in the gas utility Gaz de France, is expected to raise 6 billion euros ($6.26 billion). First-time stock sales worldwide slid 30 percent, to $66 billion, in 2002, the lowest in at least four years, Bloomberg data shows. Consequently, underwriting fees for the Goldman Sachs Group, Merrill Lynch and other securities firms fell an estimated $900 million. A rebound in initial offerings would not only enable companies to raise money and help revive stalled economies, but would also bring relief to underwriters. Wall Street firms have cut more than 54,000 jobs since March 2001 as a slump in global stock sales and corporate mergers has eroded investment-banking fees. Initial offerings generate higher underwriting fees than secondary share sales or corporate bond offerings. Underwriting fees for first-time share sales average about 3 percent of the money raised and can go as high as 7 percent, investment bankers said. ""Business will pick up once C.E.O.'s and boardrooms gain confidence in the economic outlook,"" said Jim Birle, who helps lead global equity capital markets at Merrill Lynch. The United States economy will probably expand 2.8 percent this year after growing 2.3 percent in 2002, according to the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey for November. The economy grew at a 4 percent annual rate in the third quarter of last year, and consumer confidence rose in December to a four-month high. Europe and Japan are not sharing in that growth. Germany's economy, the biggest in Europe, may contract in the first quarter as production falls and unemployment rises. Japan's government expects its economy, the world's second-largest, to expand 0.6 percent in the year starting April 1, slowing from a 0.9 percent pace this fiscal year. Initial public offering volume in the United States will probably pick up along with economic growth by the second quarter and may rise about 15 to 20 percent for the year, underwriters and investors predict. That increase would put offerings as high as $34 billion for the year, well below the levels of 1999 and 2000. In 2002, offerings in the United States slumped 38 percent from 2001, to $28 billion, making last year's total the smallest raised since the $16.8 billion raised in 1991, according to Dealogic. The biggest initial offering of 2002 was the sale of the CIT Group by Tyco International in July. It raised $4.87 billion. Travelers Property Casualty, a Citigroup unit, completed a $4.27 billion offer in March. The Travelers sale helped vault the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup into the top spot among global initial public offering underwriters with $10.1 billion of sales, Bloomberg data shows, up from fourth place in 2001. Goldman, the leader in 2001, fell to second. It kept its place as the biggest underwriter of overall share sales. This year could see some bigger offerings. The Bloomberg IPO Index, which tracks the performance of American stocks in their first year of trading, has risen 17 percent since Oct. 9. ""That suggests to us a nice 2003"" for offerings, said Kathleen Shelton Smith, one of the managers of Renaissance Capital's $15 million IPO Plus Fund. Ms. Smith said she expected Verizon Wireless, the cellphone unit of Verizon Communications, with $16 billion in annual sales, to complete a planned offering in 2003. Offerings are also expected from Meridian Automotive Systems, Noveon and Loews Cineplex Entertainment, each with $1 billion in annual sales; Converse, the sneakers maker; and Orbitz, the online travel company. China may generate some of the year's biggest global offerings as its government accelerates sales of state companies. Guangdong Grid, southern China's biggest utility, and the China Netcom Group, the nation's No. 2 fixed-line phone company, each plan initial share sales of more than $1 billion. Chinese companies sold $4.9 billion of shares in first-time sales in 2002 and may double that figure this year, bankers said. The biggest sales in 2002 were by the Bank of China's Hong Kong unit and the China Telecom Corporation, a unit of the country's leading fixed-line phone company. ""Global markets have suffered, but for Asia, particularly North Asia, it's been business as usual,"" said Stephen Metcalfe, head of Asian equity syndication for Credit Suisse First Boston, who helped sell $286 million of shares for China Oilfield Services in November. This year in Asia, he said, ""is going to be all about China, China, China."" Asian companies outside Japan raised $19 billion from first-time domestic and overseas share sales last year, with $15 billion coming from China. Including Japan, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 39 percent of initial offerings globally, Bloomberg data shows. In Europe, companies are postponing planned offerings as the continent's biggest economies lag behind American growth. Europe's biggest share sale this year may be by a company that is already publicly traded. France Telecom, Europe's most indebted phone company, plans to sell additional stock worth as much as 15 billion euros ($15.65 billion) in the first quarter. France's government also plans to sell remaining stakes in companies including Renault, the auto maker. In Japan, where the stock market lost value for a fifth year in six, the largest share sales planned are secondary sales by the government. The biggest due this year is the sale of a government stake worth about $2 billion in Japan Tobacco, the nation's cigarette-manufacturing monopoly. The sale was scrapped in July because of stock market declines. http://www.nytimes.com Graphic   Photo: Verizon Wireless, the cellphone unit of Verizon, with $16 billion in annual sales, is expected to sell shares to the public this year.

2003-01-01,"Mason bowled over by one-day call-up",46,"MANAWATU pace bowler Mike Mason doesn't believe he will be picked for the cricket World Cup despite joining the Black Caps in Christchurch. Mason was yesterday called into the one-day side replacing the injured Shane Bond (side strain) for today's day-nighter against India. He is in the New Zealand squad for two games. The next match is at Queenstown on Saturday. He said he was glad the selectors were picking on form but believed his only chance to join the 15 to South Africa would come if there were injuries. Meanwhile, he was glad his girlfriend, Michelle Frey, had her cellphone switched on yesterday. He'd packed his gear after helping Central Districts beat Wellington on Monday, had tossed his mobile phone in his cricket bag and left it there. They were driving to New Plymouth for CD's next one-dayer against Otago on Thursday when Michelle received the summons as they entered Wanganui. Mason was told to head straight back and catch a plane from Palmerston North to Christchurch. ""It's all happening a bit too fast again. I was ready for my day off,"" laughed Mason. This time he was hoping to play rather than be the 12th man as he was for the two tests against India. ""Hopefully I'll get a game otherwise the Stags are missing out if I'm not playing."" He went for only 22 runs off his 10 overs at Wellington and for the fourth time dismissed NZ captain Stephen Fleming. In the previous one-dayer at Nelson, Mason conceded only 14 runs off his 10 overs against Canterbury. He has given up only two fours. ""I was pretty gutted about that; they were both mental lapses by me."" He said his experience has taught him what works. ""I'm focusing more on bowling line and length and not giving the batsmen anything, no four balls. Bowling to a plan, bit more of a thinking game."""
2003-01-02,"Matrix is city slick",47,"Time was, when something held five people and had a tailgate, it was called a station wagon. But that isn't fashionable anymore, and the folks at Toyota prefer to call the 2003 Matrix a ""crossover utility vehicle."" Which is a shame, because as station wagons go, this is a pretty cool one. Built exclusively in Cambridge, and based on the all-new Corolla, the Matrix is a sister to the Pontiac Vibe. Once behind the wheel, I'm seriously in love with the Matrix's instrument cluster. I'm 5 feet, 4 inches, and I've spent most of my life seeing only half the gauges. These are arranged in a semi-circle and are visible no matter how the wheel is tilted. Torstar News Service I'm less enthralled by their vivid shade of red, which I found hard on the eyes after a while. But it's an edginess Toyota is counting on to woo younger drivers. Tranquil blue just doesn't cut it with the neon-is-necessity crowd. The dash is appealing, with metallic accents against a dark, glare-free surface. The stereo is up top and easily accessed. I give the heater controls a big thumbs-up, too. They're big, simple dials that turn easily, even with gloves. And the vents are way-cool. They open and close with a touch on the louvres, and spin to direct the air flow. The seat, however, is thumbs-down. I've sat in a lot of home-built hot rods, with seats made of a plank and foam rubber. That's exactly what the Matrix feels like. It's tolerable for jaunts around town. But I can't possibly imagine driving this car on a long trip and still having any butt left. The driving position is perfect for me. I was able to sit back far enough from the airbag and still reach the pedals, and I had sufficient side-to-side room for my legs. But the big-'n'-tall gentlemen I asked to sit in it didn't find it so. Their complaints ranged from a too-narrow seat to a tiny armrest on the door. Since the small storage console is set back, to allow enough room for the somewhat awkward coffee-cup holders, one also said he didn't like not having a place to rest his right elbow. That console, by the way, contains a power outlet, so you can hide your cellphone while it's charging. A couple of the controls could use some fine-tuning. It's beyond me why the most convenient setting on the rear wiper control simply squirts a stream of washer fluid, without activating the wiper. (You have to go three more clicks to get both at once.) And since my car didn't have rolling locks, the power lock button -- and the interior light wheel -- should light up with the headlights on. The rear seats offer more space than I expected, although if the front seats are set back or reclined, bigger passengers might be cramped. You're not going to haul four happy football players in this car, even with the expansive headroom. Fit and finish is generally good, with no squeaks or rattles, although my tester had a discrepancy in dash fit against the windshield pillars, and the passenger visor mirror was improperly installed. Matrix shines in the cargo department, of course. With the rear seats upright, I got 13 bags of groceries in the back, and could have put in half that many again without cracking the eggs. Under the floor is a small storage area around the spare tire, and a spot to stow the security cover, when you're not using it to keep your belongings from prying eyes. The 60/40 rear seats flip forward to form a 1.4 metre (58 inch) long flat floor. The passenger seat also folds, to open the car 2.4 metres (8 feet) to the front. With both passenger seats down, and one rear seat up, I can haul both the lumber and the husband to carry it. The folded-down floor is hard plastic, so it's easy to slide cargo in. Toyota thought about how to keep it in place, too. There are eight tie rings in the body and more in the floor (along with child-seat tether anchors). But, cleverly, there are also deck rails in the floor. Movable loops, with tie-down straps, can be used to secure the load no matter where it is. A nice touch is a relocking feature on the keyless entry. If you open the car with the electronic fob but don't get in it for a few minutes, it locks again. Great for the days when you'd forget your head if it wasn't screwed on. Under the hood is a four-cylinder, 1.8-litre engine that is noisy but efficient, if a bit sluggish. The engines are rated from 123 to 180 hp, depending on the model and driveline (it comes in Matrix, XR and the top-of-the-line XRS, and two- or four-wheel drive). I had 123 horses to motivate the ""4WD"" wagon, but it's a moot point; it's made at 6000 rpm, which I only hit momentarily by mashing the pedal. That'll get you out of tight spots. In reality, it'll get those 13 grocery bags home without breaking the gas budget. Once up to speed, it moves along quite well. I frequently found myself checking the speedo to discover I'd passed the legal limit 20 km ago. I spent $31.09 at 73.5 cents a litre (I never need fuel on cheaper days) to go 410 km. That gave me a real-world figure of 10.36 litres per 100 km in winter driving, with the four-speed automatic transmission. My tester had a ""4WD"" badge on the tailgate, but it really isn't. Toyota calls the system V-Flex; it has a viscous coupling at the rear differential. In plain English, it's a front-wheel-drive car most of the time. If the front wheels start to slip, the back wheels start to turn. It's a good system; when I gave it a shot of gas on my snowy driveway, I could feel the back wheels bite in. It gives the traction advantage of four-wheel-drive, but without the gas consumption when you don't need it. Whether it's worth the extra $3,670 will depend on your driving habits and conditions. Just remember that it's meant for slippery streets, not off-road capability. The Matrix comes with a 36-month/60,000 km warranty and roadside assistance on the complete vehicle, and an additional 60/100,000 on the powertrain. Base price for the 2WD version is $16,645. My 4WD version started at $20,315, with a $2,730 package including 16-inch alloy wheels, cruise control, remote-control mirrors and keyless entry (but no power windows). With freight and delivery it came to $24,040. I really liked the car, but I'd prefer to see at least two grand come off that before I call it good value. It's a cool, edgy package wrapped around a versatile cargo hauler that's perfect for city life, if not necessarily for long-haul trips. In short, a pretty good station wagon.

2003-01-02,"Morning after the night before",48,"Hundreds of arrests - and the sexual violation of a teenage boy in Whangamata sand dunes - belied the relatively good mood of most New Year celebrations. The year began with plenty of hangovers in police cells yesterday morning after more than 780 revellers were arrested, mainly for breaches of liquor bans in North Island resorts and in Auckland. Fewer than 100 were arrested in South Island resorts such as Queenstown, where nude partygoers plunged into the chilly waters of Lake Wakatipu. Headaches of a different sort are still being suffered by thousands of Vodafone mobile phone users in various Coromandel and Bay of Plenty resorts, as the company struggles to find the cause of transmission problems which began at midday on New Year's Eve. Parental concerns are running high among those unable to contact teenage offspring to ensure they did not end the night in a cell. But despite the size of the round-up - bigger in some traditional troublespots than last summer - police around the country are pleased most crowds rang in 2003 in good humour. Their largest catch was in Whangamata, where they swooped on 195 revellers for breaching a ban on drinking liquor in public places after 4pm and on a further 23 for driving offences. One was a disqualified drink-driver clocked at 120km/h in a 50km/h zone. The police are also investigating several sexual violation allegations, including one involving a 16-year-old youth attacked in sand dunes about 2am yesterday near Beach Access No 6. They are seeking a Pakeha man aged in his 50s, and witnesses including a woman in her mid-20s who went to the youth's aid. Sergeant Vince Ranger says there were relatively few arrests considering the size of crowds at the popular Coromandel resort, and he is hailing Whangamata's tightly enforced liquor ban for preventing any recurrence of major disturbances. About 40,000 holidaymakers descended on the town, up to 25,000 of whom gathered at Williamson Park and the adjoining surf club for the big countdown. ""It was a good night with a big crowd - I would say it was one of the biggest crowds we have had down here for a number of years."" Down the coast at Mt Maunganui, Senior Sergeant Duncan MacLeod hailed the night as ""a complete success"" despite 188 arrests - 54 more than last year - among about 20,000 revellers. The Mount's most outlandish tourist attraction, a temporary holding pen dubbed ""Alcatraz"", hosted up to 50 offenders at a time waiting to be processed and bailed as several drunks slept off their excesses in two furniture trucks set up behind the town's police station. Auckland police arrested 130 people among about 150,000 gathered in the city's centre, mostly for breaches of a liquor ban in force for the first time during New Year festivities. Inspector Brent Holmes praised the ban, saying there was considerable less drunkenness than last year and very little threatening behaviour. Police in Northland arrested 70 people, but only six at the Haruru Falls rock concert near Paihia, which drew a crowd of 11,000. Most were for liquor offences, with cases of general crime, including assaults and theft, reportedly down on last year. About 30 people were arrested in Hamilton and 24 in Taupo, where seven revellers were hurt falling down the same lakeside bank that claimed the life of a Wellington man on Sunday. Meanwhile, Vodafone suspects a computer software problem for continuing and puzzling failures in large parts of Pauanui, Hahei, Whitianga and Whangamata on the Coromandel Peninsula and Ohope and Opotiki in the eastern Bay of Plenty. Acting technical director Steve Gallie said crews were working around the clock to isolate the problem, which was persisting intermittently in 11 of its cellphone sectors, affecting thousands of voice and text messages. Company spokeswoman Sarah Williams said the problem was highly unusual, and not one that could be blamed on overloading by revellers. Some calls were getting through, with the system running at near-normal capacity yesterday morning before blinking out again. ""We understand this is extremely frustrating for our customers,"" said Ms Williams. ""We just can't apologise enough."""
2003-01-02,"MULTIFACETED; USC'S PALMER READY FOR NFL … AND ANYTHING ELSE",49,"Carson Palmer, University of Southern California quarterback, 23-year-old Heisman Trophy winner, is a romantic.  He surprised Shaelyn Fernandes with dinner at an outdoor table at a cliff-top restaurant overlooking Dana Point in California. This on a day he had football practice, on a day NFL scouts had come by to poke, prod, time and weigh him.  He was frazzled and running late, and it was in the middle of his most fabulous season, but Palmer, from Laguna Niguel, Calif., never lost his poise, never varied from his plan. That is the Palmer method. Never panic, never complain. ""I couldn't figure it out,"" Fernandes, a former USC soccer goalie, said. ""We were running late, and I told Carson, 'Just call the restaurant and say we'll be late.' But Carson wouldn't do it.  ""When we got to the restaurant, I understood. We were taken outside to this single table overlooking the ocean. We had our own waiter and violin player. Everything was ready. When dessert came, it was under a cover, and the waiter took the cover off and there was the ring.  ""It's a perfect ring, just what I would want. Carson picked it out himself, and it showed how well he knew me. And then I was trying to call my parents. I was calling their cell phones and home phone and no one was answering. It turns out Carson and his family had arranged for my parents to fly [from Northern California] to Carson's parents' house. When we went after dinner, everybody was there.""  Carson Palmer is a goof.  His younger brother, Jordan, 18, a freshman quarterback at Texas-El Paso, remembers the time Carson cut the tips off golf tees, put them into a BB gun and shot Jordan in the back. Jordan called their mother, Danna at work and yelled, ""Carson shot me in the back."" Jordan didn't mention the golf tips or the BB gun. Danna rushed home, imagining the horror. She found two boys fighting.  ""That was pretty much the end of my working outside the home,"" she said.  Carson Palmer is a planner.  His older sister, Jennifer, 31, remembers how Carson would always send Jordan out to try new, scary things first.  ""Water skiing, fishing, skiing, snowboarding, Carson would send Jordan down first, just to see how it went,"" she said.  ""Yeah, I was kind of like the food tester,"" Jordan said.  Carson Palmer is a throwback.  USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett, a man who appreciates action instead of speaking and admires old-fashioned values, said Palmer ""could have played on our teams.""  Garrett played at USC in the 1960s, when athletes didn't dance after touchdowns or parade around after every big play. When Garrett played football, men accepted responsibility for mistakes, took the blame, shared the praise.  ""Carson Palmer,"" Garrett said, ""has never wanted to distinguish himself from others, has never shied away from responsibility, always took blame when he played badly, always deflected praise when he had earned it. He handles winning the same as defeat. He could have played with us. He would have fit in nicely.""  Carson Palmer is a prankster.  USC wide receiver Keary Colbert, who lives with Palmer and six other players in a house near campus, said Palmer loves practical jokes, that Palmer knows where to shop for joke props -- ""I didn't even know they had stores like that,"" Colbert said -- and was a victim when Palmer bought fake dog poop and put it in the living room so that when housemates came through the door, Palmer could sit and watch.  Colbert was a victim.  ""I walked in and said, 'Whose dog did that?' "" Colbert said. Then Colbert saw Palmer laughing.  Carson Palmer can't play soccer.  ""He toe-kicks the ball straight ahead every time,"" Fernandes said. ""He tries to score on me, and he can't even get the ball near the goal. It's pretty funny.""  Carson Palmer is an athlete, a great athlete.  When he was 3 1/2, his mother took Carson along to a golf tournament Jennifer had entered. Though he had never played, he pestered his mother until she entered him in the 5-and-under division.  ""And Carson won,"" Danna said.  Until fifth grade, Bill Palmer, Carson's dad, hoped Carson would play basketball, like his oldest son, Robert, who is 37 and a financial planner in Baltimore.  ""I had resisted Carson playing football,"" Bill said. ""I just saw too many kids getting hurt, and the coaching wasn't very good. But I finally gave in. He wanted it too much.""  By seventh grade, Carson Palmer was being introduced to Bob Johnson, the Mission Viejo quarterback guru whose son Rob, played at USC and is in the NFL.  ""What I saw,"" Johnson said, ""was a tall seventh grader who came from a great family, who wanted to work hard, who wanted to learn, who kept a good head about him. Early on, I told his dad, 'You've got something here. There's potential that's pretty nice.' I didn't go overboard -- he was still just a seventh grader -- and I didn't ever get into saying this guy's going to be this or that. I was not going to say he was going to USC, or going to win the Heisman, or go on to pro ball, even though I heard a lot of people talk that way.""  Carson Palmer will lead USC against Iowa tonight in the Orange Bowl.  Palmer completed 288 of 458 passes for 3,639 yards, with 32 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. Besides the Heisman, Palmer won the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, given to the nation's top senior quarterback, and the Pop Warner Award as the top senior on the West Coast.  He is 6 feet 6, 230 pounds and is considered a strong possibility to be the first player drafted in April.  He will praise himself only a little, give himself credit only in a backhanded way.  ""I think I've become a better player mentally,"" Palmer said. ""I learned a lot from all the mistakes I've made. I've learned simply from playing so many games.""  Palmer will brush aside the injuries -- a broken collarbone ended his sophomore season early -- the coaching changes, the offensive changes, the criticism he heard.  ""I know some of it hurt him,"" Fernandes said, ""but he never let anybody know that.""  All of this has made Palmer more ready than most college players for the pros.  ""I think Carson has matured in a very special way,"" USC Coach Pete Carroll said. ""He had been a golden boy since high school. He never got to realize the fun. He didn't meet expectations until this year. Then he exceeded them.  ""It's very difficult to be an NFL quarterback and it's very difficult to be a high draft pick with all the expectations that go along with that. Almost all rookie quarterbacks get pounded and look like they'll never find their stride. But Carson, he's been through all that at USC. You can't find a guy more prepared for the rigors of the NFL.""  Or just about anything else. Graphic   PHOTO: Gary I. Rothstein/Associated Press: Heisman Trophy winner Carson Palmer is so much more than just a quarterback."

2003-01-01,"New Year's Time",51,"Somehow it's always a surprise when the old calendar comes to an end and it's time to hang up a new one. It hardly seems possible that all those days, so empty and abundant just a year ago, have now been used up. To an electronic calendar -- the kind you find on computers and P.D.A.'s and cellphones -- all years are equal, just one screen among many, businesslike, circumspect, immaculate. When the electronic year quietly rolls over, there's no sense of transition, nothing like the act of taking down a kitchen calendar stained with the year's events, the months dog-eared and paper-clipped, the days pasted over with stick-on reminders for dental appointments and the dogs' heartworm pills. A calendar like that is full of emendations and erasures and crossings-out, a record of changes of plan and purpose. If only the past were as easily emended.  But if there's any fixing to be done, it will have to be done in the future. That never seems quite as apparent as it does on New Year's Day. Of all the holidays on the calendar, this is, in some sense, the most secular one, a holiday open to whatever we choose to make of it. Today acknowledges no presidents or heroes or peoples or movements or births or deaths or even retail incentives. It nods merely to the fact of us and the turning of the year. Today may mean a cornucopia of college football or a chance to recover from New Year's Eve. But looking at a new calendar makes it clear, as nothing else can, that the year is a vessel full of only so many days and that one's life is a vessel full of only so many years. Seen that way, a new calendar naturally looks like a moral proposition.   It occurs to nearly everyone, sooner or later, to wonder why we measure out our lives in years. The good answers are astronomical and cultural, but they're really not good enough, as answers go. The fact is that in the strange business of being human, nearly the strangest thing of all is the consciousness of time. How can a year seem so short and so long all at once, like the one that ended last night? Looking ahead, it's possible to say that the coming year, 2003, will contain 365 days. It's impossible to say, from here, just how long they'll take. It's impossible, really, even to say how it got to be 2003.  http://www.nytimes.com"
2003-01-01,"NEWS IN BRIEF",52,"Job interview leads to theft charges Landing a job is tough, especially when you get accused of stealing from the person interviewing you. But that's what police said a Randallstown woman did during a job interview at a Gambrills assisted-living center Thursday. Police charged Lisa R. Griffin, 40, with theft after she allegedly stole a cell phone, a $100 bill and several bottles of pills from the desk and purse of Sandy Barley of Kris-Leigh Assisted Living. According to police, Ms. Barley left Ms. Griffin in her office during the interview for 10 minutes shortly before 6 p.m. and returned to find Ms. Griffin behind her desk putting bottles of medication in her purse. When confronted, Ms. Griffin apologized and gave back four bottles of pills, police said. Ms. Barley then realized a $100 bill was missing from her pocketbook. After Ms. Griffin denied taking it, Ms. Barley called police. At the Southern District Station in Edgewater, officers strip-searched Ms. Griffn after a metal detector kept activating. Police said they recovered a Nokia cell phone and $127 hidden on her body. Police gave Ms. Barley back the phone and a $100 bill. She declined to comment. Investigators probe fires in Hanover County fire investigators are searching for the cause of two fires at a Hanover construction site near Arundel Mills mall over the weekend that caused $24,000 damage. Firefighters responded to the first blaze about 3:35 a.m. Saturday at the Hillside Office Park near Dorsey and Wright roads in Hanover and found a 12-by-46-foot trailer on fire, said Capt. Lee Cornwell, a Fire Department spokesman. By the time firefighters had the blaze under control about 35 minutes later, it was all but destroyed, he said. At about about 3:11 a.m. Monday, crews were called back to the site and found another trailer at the site ablaze, Capt. Cornwell said. It also was heavily damaged. The trailers, owned by Allied Trailer Leasing in Savage, were part of the construction site for the new Corporate Express office supply and distribution center.

Sony, of course, does not have a magical way to overcome the audio limitations of cellphones.  But it asserts that the models block unwanted noise better than most sets and are more comfortable as well.  The DR-E110 (for phones with a standard 2.5-millimeter jack) and the DR-E110N4 (which fits some Nokia phones) are earbud-style headsets. Both come with foam pads to accommodate various shapes of ears and sell for $10.   The four other models are single-ear variations on Sony's ear-clip headphones for music listening. The DR-J115 (pictured) and its Nokia-compatible counterpart each cost $15. The DR-J120 and a similar model for Nokia phones are $5 more but come with a superior, noise-reducing microphone.

2003-01-01,"Palestinian Seeks Reform by Following the Money",56,"Waving reams of fiscal data, a small man in a gray suit charged the barricades of Palestinian reform here today.   It may have looked like the arid presentation of an annual budget, to the legislature of the Palestinian Authority. But it amounted to something more revolutionary.   First, because there was a 2003 budget proposal at all.  Second, because it was being disclosed publicly, in detail. Third, and most striking, because it included seemingly bland provisions that if enacted would have major consequences for the conduct, not only of Palestinian governance, but also of the Palestinian uprising. Take, for example, one apparent yawner: direct deposit of police salaries. This measure would strip Palestinian security chiefs of the control they now have over their forces' pay, which some have used to build unaccountable fiefs. It would also twist shut what students of the Palestinian Authority say is a tap for financing some Palestinian militants. The man in the gray suit, Salam Fayyad, has been praised by both American and Israeli officials since he was appointed to his post as Palestinian finance minister by Yasir Arafat in June.  That is something of a problem for the finance minister, a former official of the International Monetary Fund who was educated in Lebanon and Texas. Palestinians consider the Bush administration biased in favor of Israel. The 27-month-long conflict has made them suspicious if not contemptuous of any change -- and any Palestinian -- conforming to American and Israeli demands. When these concerns about outside influence were mentioned to Mr. Fayyad after his presentation, he became so exercised that he dropped his black satchel and began jabbing the air with one index finger. ""I'm talking about public funds -- public money -- the people's money!"" he said in rapid-fire English. ""We should manage the funds in an honest way. Tell me if this is not inspired by the Palestinian people. Tell me if the Palestinian people do not benefit from this."" Palestinian legislators, many of whom have chafed at corruption in the Palestinian Authority, said they expected the budget to pass within a month, and then for the real fight to begin: to enact its provisions against officeholders vested in the status quo. ""Either he will submit to their demands, or resign,"" Jamal Shobaki, the chairman of the legislature's economic committee, said of Mr. Fayyad, expressing what he called a common fear among reformers. ""What we want is a third way -- that he neither submit, nor resign."" Mr. Fayyad, who is 50, smiled when told of the comment, and said he knew a third way. ""When you hit a wall,"" he said, ""you go through it."" Mr. Fayyad, who has presented Mr. Arafat with his budget, is careful to emphasize his loyalty to the Palestinian leader. Yet his proposals, if enacted, would remove levers of patronage and contracting that Mr. Arafat has relied on for years to run the Palestinian Authority, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and his dominant faction, Al Fatah. As a result, Israeli officials reacted to the proposed budget with skepticism, along with rare praise for a Palestinian minister. ""Everything that Fayyad is trying to do is well appreciated and is the right thing,"" said Raanan Gissin, the spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon. ""But it's like full gas in neutral, as long as the money eventually reaches Arafat."" But Mr. Arafat appears to be somewhat boxed in by his finance minister. It would be a serious blow to the Palestinian Authority's remaining credibility abroad -- including in Europe, which has given the Palestinians considerable funds -- if Mr. Fayyad felt forced to resign. Although he said he supported reform and democracy, Mr. Arafat did not speak about the budget as he addressed supporters here today, the anniversary of Al Fatah's founding in 1965. A Western diplomat said Mr. Fayyad had ""thrown down a gauntlet in front of the security services,"" adding that this ""puts the authority in a very difficult position because of Fayyad's international credibility."" In this diplomat's appraisal, Mr. Fayyad appeared to be recruiting sidelined Palestinian institutions -- the budget, the legislature -- for wide-ranging reform, using the budget proposal to lend precision to popular but rather amorphous ideas for change. No budget was issued for 2002, and before that, the details of the budgets were not disclosed. Mr. Fayyad made a point of posting his $1.28 billion proposal on a new Web site, which was also started today (www.mof.gov.ps).  He said his budget assumed that the Palestinian economy would contract by about 7 percent next year. He said the Palestinian G.D.P. now amounted to slightly under $2 billion.  While he referred to the devastating impact of Israel's offensives into Palestinian areas, he spoke more about what Palestinians could do to take control of their fiscal destiny, peppering his presentation with words like ""transparency,"" ""audit,"" and, repeatedly, ""credibility."" Mr. Fayyad, who was raised in the West Bank town of Tulkarm, was for several years the representative of the I.M.F. to the Palestinian Authority, and he appears to have been storing up ideas of what he would do if he was in charge.  Among other changes, he said he would ensure compliance by all ministries with Palestinian laws about procurement. He specifically referred to the purchasing body for the security services, which Palestinians call the Rock. Experts say the Rock is used to generate kickbacks and patronage for security officials.  Mr. Fayyad called its relationship to the security agencies ""a clear violation of the law"" and said it ""should not, and will not, be allowed to continue."" The proposal would advance several efforts he has already undertaken, like putting auditors in all the ministries and consolidating multiple investment and commercial operations in one closely watched fund. Mr. Fayyad, who has a doctorate from the University of Texas, served as a scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank in St. Louis and as an I.M.F. official in Washington. He has little popular support, but he gained some credibility in August, when he found himself trapped by a renewed Israeli siege of Mr. Arafat's compound.  The Israelis came in so swiftly, after back-to-back suicide bombings killed seven people besides the bombers, that he lost his cellphone and briefcase. They were crushed by a tank inside the taxi in which he had arrived at the compound. Before American pressure forced the Israelis to withdraw, Mr. Fayyad spent 10 days in the compound, sharing a small, airless bedroom with Mr. Arafat and two other officials. At one point, he recalled, the Israelis demanded that everyone evacuate the compound, saying they were about to demolish it. ""I thought to myself, 'This is it,' "" he said. Contrary to Palestinian rumor, Mr. Fayyad is not an American citizen. Chain-smoking, as usual, in Mr. Arafat's compound today, he said he knew some Palestinians viewed him as ""this guy who came from the I.M.F."" But he shrugged that off. ""I know who I am,"" he said. ""Our people deserve respect, and if I can contribute to that, what more can I ask for?"" http://www.nytimes.com Graphic   Photo: Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian finance minister, in Yasir Arafat's compound in Ramallah yesterday.

The 40-year-old Regina man spent nearly two days shivering in his stuck van before he decided to make his dangerous crawl for help New Year's Eve. He was found on the road by a farmer who had joined a search for him. The Regina Leader-Post Mr. Brady said he kept warm by running his van for 15 minutes every hour, huddling with his two dogs and using underwear as a head covering. But fearing he might not have enough gasoline to survive another night in the sub zero temperatures, he dismantled his wheelchair Tuesday morning, threw it out the driver's door and started his quest for help. ""When I got to the snowdrifts on the road I'd get out of my chair and drag it through the drifts and then get back in it,"" he said. ""I just wanted to survive."" Push by push through snowdrift after snowdrift, Mr. Brady trekked about a kilometre before farmer Larry Menke discovered him Tuesday afternoon. Mr. Menke, 64, had heard radio reports that a Regina man had disappeared after visiting friends in the area and had climbed in his four-wheel drive vehicle to help search for him on the hilly back roads. After discovering Mr. Brady's van, Mr. Menke followed his wheelchair tracks through the snow until he came upon him on the road. ""His shoes were full of snow and he said: 'Thank goodness somebody found me.' It was pretty emotional there for awhile,"" said Mr. Menke. ""What would have happened if someone came over the hills and run over top of him because he couldn't get out of the road?"" Mr. Brady was last seen Sunday at 9:30 p.m. He was bound for Regina after leaving a friend's farm, about 60 kilometres east of Swift Current. Snow was blowing and roads were slick with freezing rain. He said that in the darkness, he missed the turn back to the highway. He turned instead down a dead-end road where his van became stuck in a snowbank. Mr. Brady said he tried in vain to free the vehicle, placing a dog dish and the van's floor mats under the tires for traction, before resigning himself to waiting for help. He was cold and wet when he dragged himself back into his van, he said. Although he had extra clothing with him, it was difficult for him to change in his vehicle. ""I had an extra sweater and a couple pairs of boxer shorts and that's what I wore on my head to conserve body heat,"" he said. Without food, water, blankets or a cellphone, he settled in for a long wait, listening to bulletins about his disappearance on his van's radio. ""I felt bad that everyone was looking for me,"" he said.

Michael was last seen Sunday night. He was bound for Regina after leaving a friend's farm in the Hodgeville area, about 60 kilometres east of Swift Current. Snow was blowing and roads were slick with freezing rain. Saskatchewan News Network; Regina Leader-Post He wasn't carrying a cellphone and was travelling alone, except for his two dogs Cocoa and Willy, a Bouvier and a Portuguese Waterdog. ""As I left Highway 63, I got a wind gust and I missed my turn on the highway and I got out on a grid road,"" he said in a telephone interview from his Regina home Wednesday. ""I didn't realize I was on a grid at the time because snow covered the road."" Confused, he turned left instead of right. ""There was a white-out and I slipped off the road enough that I couldn't move my van anywhere. I sat there for 41 hours and waited."" He got out of the van Sunday night to see how stuck he was and scratched his knee -- his only injury. ""I took a bowl that the dogs food was in and I dug under the tires and I tried to put the floor mats under the tires to see if they would grip so I could pull myself out."" Foiled, he dragged his cold and wet body into the van. ""I had an extra pair of jeans, but it was hard for me to change in the van,"" he said. ""I had an extra sweater and a couple pairs of boxer shorts and that's what I wore on my head to conserve body heat because I just had a baseball hat."" Without food, water or blankets, he started his vehicle every two hours for 15 minutes to keep warm and cuddled his dogs. While the van was running Tuesday he was relieved to hear about efforts to find him on a radio newscast. The community of Hodgeville, RCMP and church groups searched from Sunday, through Monday and into Tuesday for Michael. Search efforts were hampered Monday by poor road conditions. That evening RCMP asked for the public's help in finding Michael. On Tuesday the RCMP co-ordinated an air and ground search of the rolling terrain between Hodgeville and Moose Jaw. Michael's father, Warren, and others searched around the clock. Thinking he may not have enough fuel to survive another night, Michael dismantled his wheelchair Tuesday morning, threw it out the driver's door and started his quest for help. ""When I got to the snow drifts on the road I'd get out of my chair and drag it through the drifts and then get back in it. I just wanted to survive -- nothing more. I know that I would have been fairly cold, but I would have made it to the house or close enough to get their attention. It would have taken me awhile because there was a lot of snow between me and them."" Push by push, drift by drift, Michael was half a mile from the van when Larry Menke, an area farmer, found him Tuesday afternoon just east of where he was last seen. Menke didn't hear that Michael was lost until Tuesday at 1 p.m. Then he got into his four-wheel drive and started searching the hilly back roads. The 64-year-old was shocked when he found Michael's empty van. He followed wheelchair tracks and found him at 2:30 p.m."
2003-01-03,"Paraplegic survives stranding in snow",59,"REGINA (CP) -- Desperate to get help after his van was stranded in a prairie snowstorm, paraplegic Michael Brady dragged himself down a country road pulling his wheelchair through the snowdrifts. The 40-year-old Regina man spent nearly two days shivering in his stuck van before he decided to make his dangerous crawl for help New Year's Eve. He was found on the road by a farmer who had joined a search for him. Canadian Press Brady said he kept warm by running his van for 15 minutes every hour, huddling with his two dogs and using underwear as a head covering. But fearing he might not have enough gasoline to survive another night in the sub zero temperatures, he dismantled his wheelchair Tuesday morning, threw it out the driver's door and started his quest for help. ""When I got to the snowdrifts on the road I'd get out of my chair and drag it through the drifts and then get back in it,"" he said. ""I just wanted to survive."" Push by push through snowdrift after snowdrift, Brady trekked about a kilometre before farmer Larry Menke discovered him Tuesday afternoon. Menke, 64, had heard radio reports that a Regina man had disappeared after visiting friends in the area and had climbed in his four-wheel drive vehicle to help search for him on the hilly back roads. After discovering Brady's van, Menke followed his wheelchair tracks through the snow until he came upon him on the road. ""His shoes were full of snow and he said: 'Thank goodness somebody found me.' It was pretty emotional there for awhile,"" said Menke. ""What would have happened if someone came over the hills and run over top of him because he couldn't get out of the road?"" Menke said he had a premonition Brady might be nearby. ""Something told me to go out there and try and find him,"" he said. ""This was the best New Year's present I could offer someone."" Brady was last seen Sunday at 9:30 p.m. He was bound for Regina after leaving a friend's farm in the Hodgeville area, about 60 kilometres east of Swift Current. Snow was blowing and roads were slick with freezing rain. He said that in the darkness, he missed the turn back to the highway. He turned instead down a dead-end road where his van became stuck in a snowbank. ""I had an extra sweater and a couple pairs of boxer shorts and that's what I wore on my head to conserve body heat,"" he said. Without food, water, blankets or a cell phone, he settled in for a long wait, listening to bulletins about his disappearance on his van's radio. Graphic   Photo: MICHAEL BRADY: Dogs warmed legs."
2003-01-03,"Phone rates rung up again",60,"After years of price wars, long-distance rates are going up. AT&T recently announced its first significant price increase in a year, raising the monthly fee on a popular plan by 25 percent. WorldCom's MCI unit has raised rates several times since the nation's second-largest long-distance company filed for bankruptcy protection in July, more than doubling some monthly fees to $5. The company is raising its rates again starting Feb. 1. Sprint, which already has raised several rates and fees this year, is expected to be next in line. New monthly fees and minimum charges have become increasingly common as phone companies scramble to make up for falling revenue in the second year of a brutal industry slump. The companies are taking big risks by raising prices, and are being harshly criticized for making consumers pay for their industry's woes - which include the largest accounting fraud ever at WorldCom. Competition in the $110 billion-a-year long-distance industry, which has long been fierce, is growing even more heated. Since WorldCom is operating under bankruptcy protection, it needs to boost its revenue to emerge. Beginning Feb. 1, MCI is raising per-minute rates on its Anytime Calling and Anytime Advantage plans to 9 cents a minute from 7 cents. AT&T and Sprint have also had many quarters of falling revenues in consumer long distance, something they are under intense pressure to fix. Meanwhile, the local Bell carriers including Verizon Communications and SBC Communications have gotten permission to sell long distance in many states, and are quickly rolling out discounted package deals. Just this week, SBC started offering California customers 35 percent off its retail rates when they agree to buy both local and long-distance services. Die-hard bargain hunters can turn to little-known discounters like ZoneLD that offer long-distance rates under four cents a minute. By contrast, the major companies usually charge five cents to 12 cents, depending on the plan. At the same time, consumers have been increasingly taking advantage of cell phone plans, which often offer better long-distance rates than conventional phone services. Already, about 3 percent of Americans make all their long-distance calls on their cell phone - eliminating their traditional long-distance service altogether - according to Yankee Group, a Boston consulting firm. Normally, such intense rivalry would lead to lower prices, but that isn't happening this time. That's partly because the industry is so weak it can't afford to keep cutting prices. The recent increases represent ""a correction back to what (prices) should be"" after years of unsustainable discounting, says Jennifer Love of Sprint. The Bell companies are playing along, too. Even though the Bells are financially much stronger than the long-distance giants, they have decided not to use their money to subsidize a price war. With no quick end to the industry slump in sight, phone companies are putting survival over beating the competition. They are also saving their best rates for people willing to buy lots of their services bundled together, such as local, long-distance and everything from call-waiting to high-speed Internet access. Verizon, for instance, is offering a $63-a-month plan including DSL or cell phone service and a choice of three local calling plans and two long-distance plans. It also has a $28 plan that combines local and long distance with features like caller ID. For consumers, package deals often have the best long-distance rates - but only if you call a lot. Otherwise, you end up paying for calls and services you don't use. An individual who hardly ever makes long-distance calls might be better off with something like Verizon's Timeless plan, which charges $3 for 30 minutes of long distance, or IDT Corp.'s plan that charges only five cents a minute and has a monthly fee of $3.95. Long-distance companies like MCI, for their part, are boosting their stand-alone long-distance prices partly to make their own package deals appear more attractive in comparison, says Aurica Yen of Yankee Group. MCI's Neighborhood plan, for example, includes unlimited long-distance and local calling with features like voice mail for $50 a month. Sprint is marketing its long-distance service with perks like frequent-flier miles and discounts for customers who also get wireless service from its Sprint PCS unit or Internet service from Earthlink. --- The Associated Press contributed to this story."
2003-01-01,"Photo Favorites",61,"Nearly all of the photos you see in the St. Petersburg Times, including these, are taken with digital cameras. 2002 marked the first full year that our staff of 34 photographers was outfitted with the new equipment. No film, no processing or chemicals; just a memory chip in a plastic case no larger than a pack of matches. Using a phone line or a cell phone, the image can be transmitted back to the newspaper almost immediately. Film still captures finer detail in low light and is more forgiving when the exposure is less than perfect. But now a page designer can place a news photo on a page as little as 15 minutes after the photographer presses the shutter button. The technology has raised concerns about altering the content of news photographs. Can you believe what you see? In truth, there has always been only one guarantee against photographs that lie: the integrity of the photographer and their supporting news organizations. The photo staffers at the St. Petersburg Times take their responsibility as documenters of our community and the world very seriously. We will never knowingly publish an altered news photograph. Our mission is always to reveal and enlighten, never to disguise or deceive. You may remember some of these images, chosen by the Pasco bureau's photographers as their personal favorites from 2002. We hope you enjoy seeing them again.   - SHERMAN ZENT, PICTURE EDITOR   Rodeos are very visual - from the high-flying bull riding action to the intermission antics by the clowns.

2003-01-02,"Pickup Artist's Quixotic Quest for Love",62,"Pick-up artist Jon Rubin was on lower Broadway talking about personalized fitness equipment when he noticed something shiny across the street. It was a raven-haired hottie, snottily striding down the sidewalk. Without a moment's pause, Mr. Rubin, 39, bolted across the street, galloping after the woman in her white fake fur jacket. It was time to work his magic. Walking alongside her, he looked at her, looked away, then screwed up his face and did a double take. ""Excuse me,"" he said, ""did you go to Columbia?"" ""No,"" she started walking a little faster. ""Are you sure?"" he persisted. ""Positive,"" she was starting to sound annoyed. Mr. Rubin hung back, letting her disappear into the crowd. ""I'll call that crash and burn,"" he admitted. But he didn't seem particularly disheartened. After a lifetime spent approaching women, he has grown inured to all forms of coyness, cold-heartedness, wiliness, and rejection. All things considered, Mr. Rubin is perfectly fine to look at. (He gives himself a 6 1/2 on a 1 to 10 scale). And yet, despite the Harvard degree, Upper West Side brownstone, and pair of keen green eyes, women aren't chasing after him. According to Mr. Rubin, it befalls him to approach potential mates. He uses baseball argot when describing his attempts (he calls them ""at-bats"") and estimates he instigates an ""at-bat"" once a day. The subject of Mr. Rubin's encounters with the ladies is the subject of his autobiographical documentary ""So Many Women, So Little Hair."" It will air on HBO, Showtime, Cinemax and The Movie Channel next month. Also in the works are a sitcom based on Mr. Rubin's encounters, as well as ""Pick Ups,"" a reality show in which other people put Mr. Rubin's techniques to the test. The hilarious and fast-paced documentary reports what happened when Mr. Rubin hit the streets last spring armed with three hidden cameras. He approached 20 obscenely comely women and asked if they went to Columbia. Three of his attempts elicited phone numbers. The other 17 said he just wasn't their type. While Mr. Rubin says he doesn't have a type, all the women in the movie are dewy-skinned creatures who appear to be two or three years out of adolescence. ""Age inappropriate?"" he said over a bowl of red pepper soup. ""That's a judgmental phrase."" When pressed further about his film's lack of thirty-something women, Mr. Rubin racked his memory, then countered: ""Eva Herzegovina the supermodel. She's probably 30ish. She is in the longer version but she didn't sign the release."" Mr. Rubin has been up to his at-bats since his days as an undergraduate at Harvard. Tired of waiting until Friday night rolled around before they could meet girls, he and his best friend took to ""square duty,"" which meant approaching girls in Harvard Square at any odd hour. Their line was ""Excuse me, do you know where Harvard Square is?"" His current line ""Did you go to Columbia?"" hasn't evolved much. Once he has a woman's attention, he steers the topic of conversation to something that has nothing to do with where she attended college. ""I'm quick to tell them I'm very funny and smart. And I used to be a dolphin trainer - girls like that."" The inspiration behind Mr. Rubin's audacious project comes from his favorite book: Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road."" ""It talks about how a pain stabs his heart when he sees a woman he loves go in the opposite direction. So he gets the courage to approach this girl and he ends up dating her."" Mr. Rubin doesn't see his approach to meeting women as running counter to building healthy long-term relationships. He is quick to state that he has been in four long-term relationships since college, and has met all of his ex-girlfriends via the at-bat method. ""I'm just on a quest to find that special someone."" Unfortunately, none of the ladies whose numbers he got in the movie has turned into that special someone. Two of the women never returned his calls (he gives up after three times). And Beatrude, the gaunt brunette, has been wily, to say the least. ""We went out for coffee and the next day she asked me if I wanted to go to a modeling show. Three hours later I was backstage with her changing,"" he beamed. ""But she's been flying around the world since then. She bops around a lot."" Things aren't quite as dreary as they seem, though; a month ago Mr. Rubin followed a Japanese make-up artist into Barnes and Noble, helped her pick out a make-up application book, and ended up having dinner with her that night. Over dinner, he started feeling sick and had to leave the restaurant and vomit. She followed him out with napkins. They went on a few more dates. Now Mr. Rubin is dating another young woman he met on the street. ""It's sort of like life is pretty absurd to begin with so meeting on the street is not that different."" On New Year's Eve, Mr. Rubin left a message on this reporter's cell phone. He rambled on a bit about publicity photos, then segued into: ""Hope you have a happy New Year. Do you have a date? Cause if not I - well, sorry I just felt like I had to - I know you have a date. I'm sure you have a date."""
2003-01-03,"Pilots Hurt in Crash Summon Help With Cell Phones; Fliers Are Rescued From Mountainside",63,"Student pilot Jay Watkins and his instructor, Philip White, were flying through the pitch-black night over Beaver County on Wednesday when their small plane hit the top of a ridge, flipped on its roof and slid down a steep, snow-covered slope. It came to a rest after hitting trees. Watkins, a Utah Highway Patrol trooper, used his cell phone to call the emergency services dispatcher in Beaver County at about 10 p.m. He reported that he and White were seriously injured and pinned in the Jeppesen 2000 single-engine plane. ""That cell phone saved their lives,"" said Les Whitney, the fire chief who led the rescue. The crash happened in the western area of the county in southwestern Utah, a landscape of jagged, rocky mountain ranges separated by wide desert valleys. Whitney said Watkins, 28, of Woods Cross, and White, 25, of South Salt Lake, were flying from Cedar City in Iron County to Delta, about 130 miles to the north in Millard County. For an unknown reason, an electronic locater transmitter on board the aircraft designed to activate in a crash to aid rescuers was not working. Watkins told dispatchers he thought they had just passed over Minersville, flying northeast, before the crash. He described the area they were in as steep, rocky and snow-covered, indicating they were high on a mountain. Whitney set up a command post at an automobile wrecking yard north of Minersville on state Route 21. About 45 search and rescue volunteers from Minersville and Milford joined members of the sheriff's office and UHP in a ground search, over dirt roads snaking up canyons east of the highway. Whitney said the two men told rescuers they could hear aircraft overhead, but Whitney said several other planes in the sky using the Milford airport made it impossible to tell if they were hearing the Civil Air Patrol aircraft from Cedar City taking part in the search. The crash site was finally located by a Utah Department of Public Safety helicopter dispatched from Salt Lake City and outfitted with heat-sensitive visual devices and a powerful spotlight. The helicopter dropped two emergency medical technicians near the scene and they hiked to the plane, reaching the injured men at about 1 a.m. Thursday. Temperatures at the time were near zero. The helicopter also ferried a crew with chain saws to the top of the ridge -- at an elevation of more than 8,000 feet -- to clear a landing pad among scrubby mahogany trees for medical helicopters from LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City and McKay-Dee Hospital in Ogden. Rescuers on the ridge top set up ropes lines to hoist Watkins and White up. By 5:45 a.m., the injured men had been loaded onto the helicopters; both were taken to LDS Hospital. The men were listed in serious condition Thursday night, suffering bone fractures and frostbite, said hospital spokesman Richard Nash. Sgt. David Mott, investigating the crash for the Beaver County Sheriff's Office, said the impact tore the plane apart and the smell of fuel hung in the air. Watkins was piloting the aircraft, Mott said, and thought he was flying at 8,500 feet when the side of the mountain appeared. ""But it was too late."" He said the cold temperatures may have helped the men survive by slowing the loss of blood from their wounds. It also was fortunate that the plane came to rest high enough on the north side of the ridge that the cell phones worked. ""If they had been down lower in the canyon, or not facing some towers, their phones would not have worked,"" he said. The Federal Aviation Administration has been contacted about the crash, Mott said. Dispatcher Jared Bridge said Watkins and White each had a cell phone and would talk in spurts, then turn the phones off to conserve battery power. Bridge said he and correctional officer Brady Davids who also talked to the men, reassured them that help was on the way. ""They were really good on the phone,"" said Bridge. ""They explained their injuries to us and we tried to see if they could identify a major landmark."" ""It was an excellent effort by everyone involved,"" Whitney said. ""But the bottom line is, without a phone, they would have died."""
2003-01-02,"POLICE BEAT",64,"ODENTON Video store robbed An armed couple robbed an Odenton Blockbuster video store early Saturday after tying up the employees, county police said. The man and woman entered the store at 1496 Annapolis Road shortly before 1:30 a.m. and began looking at videos. As employees prepared to close the store, the pair came to the register with video rentals. The man then showed a handgun in his waistband and demanded that all the employees come to the front of the store. He then forced them all into a rear office where the pair bound their feet and hands. The robbers stole several Sony PlayStation video game systems and an undisclosed amount of cash before leaving. The employees eventually freed themselves and called police. No one was injured. The man was described as white, in his late 30s, about 5 feet 8 inches tall, with brown hair and wearing a gray sweatshirt and green Army fatigue-style pants. The woman was described as white, in her early 20s, about 5 feet 6 inches tall with a heavy build and light brownish blond hair. She wore a black cap, a navy blue sweatshirt and black pants. GAMBRILLS Phone, cash taken Landing a job is tough, especially when you get caught stealing from the person interviewing you. But that's what police said a Randallstown woman did during a job interview at a Gambrills assisted living center on Thursday. Police charged Lisa R. Griffin, 40, with theft after she allegedly stole a cell phone, a $100 bill and several bottles of pills from the desk and purse of Sandy Barley of Kris-Leigh Assisted Living in Gambrills. According to police, Ms. Barley left Ms. Griffin in her office during the interview for about 10 minutes shortly before 6 p.m. and returned to find Ms. Griffin standing behind her desk putting bottles of medication in her purse. When confronted, Ms. Griffin said she was sorry and gave back four bottles of pills she'd taken, police said. Ms. Barley then discovered a $100 bill missing from her pocketbook. After Ms. Griffin denied taking it, Ms. Barley called police, and they searched her but didn't find the cash. However, after officers took her to a police station, they strip-searched her after a metal detector kept activating near her posterior. Police then recovered a blue Nokia cell phone and $127 in cash, police said. Police returned the phone and a $100 bill to Ms. Barley that night. Electronics store robbed Two men robbed a Gambrills electronics store Dec. 20 and bound the store manager, county police said. The men entered the Electronics Boutique at 2626 Chapel Lake Drive about 10:40 a.m. and ordered the manager to the ground at gunpoint. The robbers then walked him to a rear storage room and bound his wrists with plastic flex cuffs. After forcing the manager to the ground again, the robbers stole cash from the safe and grabbed numerous video game players and games before leaving from the back of the store. One man was described as black, between the ages of 27 and 29, heavy set, 5 feet 10 inches tall with short hair and a pudgy face, police said. The other man was described as black, between the ages of 24 and 26, with a thin build, 6 feet tall with a mustache and goatee and wearing a red backpack. SEVERN Barricade ends County police arrested a Severn man Monday who allegedly choked his girlfriend and barricaded himself in his home for more than four hours before surrendering. Michael P. Brock, 45, of 1148 Thompson Ave., was charged with first- and second-degree assault and reckless endangerment, police said. According to police, Mr. Brock pinned his girlfriend against a wall inside their home and choked her before she was able to free herself and run to a nearby business to call police about 8:15 p.m. Her name was unavailable. When police arrived, Mr. Brock refused to come outside. Several dozen members of the Special Operations Section responded and the man was eventually arrested about 12:32 a.m. after voluntarily surrendering to police Armed robbery A Severn man told county police he was robbed at gunpoint on Christmas Eve outside the Glen Burnie Mall. Eric M. Horton said he was walking through the mall parking lot about 2 p.m. when two men in a blue Chevrolet pickup truck pulled up and called him over. When Mr. Horton got to the truck, the passenger pulled out a handgun and told him to turn over his bag and money or he would be shot. Mr. Horton handed over his bag and wallet, and the truck drove away as Mr. Horton went inside to call police. One of the truck passengers was a white man in his mid 20s with a scruffy goatee, dirty blond hair cut to shoulder length and green camoflauge pants. The other passenger was a white man in his mid 20s wearing blue jeans and a backwards red baseball cap. HANOVER Trailers damaged County fire investigators are searching for the cause of two fires at a Hanover construction site over the weekend that caused $24,000 damage. Firefighters responded to the first blaze about 3:35 a.m. Saturday at the construction site at Dorsey and Wright roads and found a 12-foot-by-46-foot trailer on fire, said Capt. Lee Cornwell, a Fire Department spokesman. By the time firefighters had the blaze under control about 35 minutes later, it was all but destroyed, he said. Then Sunday about 3:11 a.m., crews were called back to the site and found another trailer at the site ablaze, Capt. Cornwell said. It also was heavily damaged. The trailers were owned by Allied Trailer Leasing and occupied by Florida Rock Properties, he said."
2003-01-03,"Preparation can help you survive winter storms",65,"Severe winter storms can bring hardship and even death. And those living in snow country should make preparations for such storms each winter. A few of the things to keep on hand include flashlights, battery-powered radios and fresh batteries and nonperishable foods. Arrange for emergency cooking capabilities (camping stove and fuel) but remember to do your cooking in a place with adequate ventilation. When a winter storm hits, stay inside as much as possible. Don't overexert yourself and don't overdo the shoveling (statistics show that as many people die of heart attacks while shoveling snow as are killed by tornadoes). When you do go out, dress warmly, with layers of loose-fitting, light-weight clothing. Wear water-repellent, wind-resistant outer garments. If you can't stay at home during a snowstorm, it's best to take a few precautions before heading out on the road. Always check the latest weather information before starting, and stay alert for weather advisories. Travel in convoys if possible. Leave earlier than usual to allow extra time to reach your destination, and keep the gas tank at least half full. In addition, always: Wear your seat belt. Keep your windshield and mirrors clear of snow and ice. Keep a winter emergency kit in your car. Items might include a flashlight, flares, booster cables, tow chain, gloves, hat, blanket, sand or kitty litter, small shovel, boots, sleeping bag, nonperishable food, windshield scraper and first-aid kit. Be especially cautious on bridges and ramps because of possibility of ice on the road. Drive at appropriate speeds for the road conditions. Keep your distance from other vehicles and obstacles. In a skid situation, if your car has an Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) maintain continuous pressure on your brakes. If your vehicle does not have ABS, pump your brakes lightly. Turn your vehicle to follow the direction of skid (if the back of vehicle moves to the left, you should turn your steering wheel to the left). If you do have to stop on the roadside during a snowstorm, choose a place protected by an underpass or a tree line. If you get stuck and you can't get the car to move, stay inside and wait for help. Do not attempt to walk out. It is too easy to become disoriented while walking in a snowstorm. Protect yourself and your vehicle by making sure others can see you. Set up warning triangles or flares, lift the hood of your car -- this indicates to the highway patrol or others that you need help, use a cell phone -- if you have one -- to call for help. Its a good idea to run the engine for short periods (10 minutes) to warm up the car. Remember to clear snow from the exhaust pipe and crack open two windows for ventilation. If you feel nauseated or sleepy, turn the engine off. Keep an overhead light on at night to make the car visible to workers or rescue crews so that you can be seen and clap you hands and move your legs to keep your blood circulation going. If you are with someone else, trade brief sleeping periods. Don't let everyone fall asleep at once.

2003-01-02,"Professors Vie With Web for Class's Attention",66,"Universities are rushing toward a wireless future, installing networks that let students and the faculty surf the Internet from laptop computers in the classroom, in the library or by those ponds that always seem to show up on the cover of the campus brochure.   But professors say the technology poses a growing challenge for them: retaining their students' attention.   In a classroom at American University in Washington on a recent afternoon, the benefits and drawbacks of the new wireless world were on display. From the back row of an amphitheater classroom, more than a dozen laptop screens were visible. As Prof. Jay Mallek lectured graduate students on the finer points of creating and reading an office budget, many students went online to Blackboard.com, a Web site that stores course materials, and grabbed the day's handouts from the ether.  But just as many students were off surfing. A young man looked at sports photos while a woman checked out baby photos that just arrived in her e-mailbox.  The screens provide a silent commentary on the teacher's attention-grabbing skills. The moment he loses the thread, or fumbles with his own laptop to use its calculator, screens flip from classroom business to leisure. Students dash off e-mail notes and send instant messages. A young man who is chewing gum shows an amusing e-mail message to the woman next to him, and then switches over to read the online edition of The Wall Street Journal. Distraction is nothing new. As long as there have been schools, students have whispered, passed notes and even gazed out the window and daydreamed. The arrival of laptop computers, however, introduced new opportunities for diversion, and wireless introduces an even broader range of distraction, said Dylan Brooks, a senior broadband and wireless analyst at Jupiter Communications. ""They could have played solitaire or Minesweeper before,"" Mr. Brooks said. ""Now they can do that or seven million other games, or watch a full-length feature film."" This is especially galling to law professors, many of whom still live in the world depicted in ""The Paper Chase,"" the 1973 film in which an imperious Prof. Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. held his students in terrified thrall.  ""This is an addictive thing that hurts the students themselves,"" said Ian Ayres, a professor at the Yale Law School who opposes much of the Internet's entry into the classroom, saying that computer use is rude and that other students are ""demoralized"" by seeing their peers' attention wander.  ""When you see 25 percent of the screens playing solitaire, besides its being distracting, you feel like a sucker for paying attention,"" Professor Ayres said. Unless law students are fully engaged in the class, he said, they miss out on the give and take of ideas in class discussion and do not develop the critical thinking skills that emerge from ""deeply tearing apart a case.""  Professor Ayres tried to prohibit all Internet use in his classroom. The students ""went ballistic,"" he said, and insisted that their multitasking ways made them more productive and even more alert in class. Lately, he said, he has loosened the restrictions, telling students they could surf from the back rows, so others would not be distracted. One professor at a law school in Texas became so upset by the level of student distraction in 2001 that he took a ladder to school, climbed up to reach the wireless transmitter in his classroom -- and disconnected it. The students protested. The administration told him to plug it back in. But the point was made, he said, and he regained the attention of the class.  In 2002, he told his students that they could not use laptops in his class at all, even for taking notes. ""It has made an enormously positive difference to shut those computers off,"" he said. Today's college students are a truly wired generation. A study in 2002 by the Pew Internet and American Life Project in Washington found that 86 percent of students have gone online, compared with 59 percent of the general population. Although the study did not focus on wireless technology, the authors did delicately predict that ""issues readily apparent with the spread of cellphones, such as etiquette and distraction, are likely to emerge as students are able to access the Internet anywhere, including in classrooms."" Dozens of colleges are going wireless, including Dartmouth, Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, the University of California at San Diego and the University of Minnesota.  The wireless rollout at American University is especially ambitious, because it integrates cellphone coverage into a single data-delivery network that can deliver messages to laptops, handheld devices and telephones anywhere on the 84-acre campus. The university plans to stop offering traditional phone service in its dormitories eventually. In any building, the wireless access ports are likely to be there, looking a little like the top half of a Lava Lamp, painted white and stuck upside-down to the ceiling. The director of e-operations at the university, Carl Whitman, said being early to the wireless world created an advantage in attracting students who demand the latest technology and ""becomes a plus for us."" Matthew Pittinsky, founder and chairman of Blackboard Inc., the large Internet education company that puts Professor Mallek's class materials online, said wireless access had ""made higher education much more of a 24/7 educational environment than ever before,"" with instant access to classroom materials and research resources and a growing potential for collaborative study.  Mr. Pittinsky said the greatest power of wireless showed up in the dorm, the library and the commons. ""There's less of an obvious use for wiring the classroom,"" where the benefits have to be balanced against the distraction, he said.  At American University, Professor Mallek said the benefits of the technology in his classroom far outweighed the problems. He ran the pilot project at the business school that helped the American decide to put in a campuswide network and said he had grown used to students' flipping their screens.  ""It's a new type of social commentary, to hear clicking,"" he said. ""It's an audible vote.""  He suggested that it might even be making him a better teacher. He takes the threat of losing his students to e-mail and online newspapers as a challenge to keep lectures interesting and lively. ""As a professor,"" he said, ""if you are not productively engaging them, they have other opportunities.""  Mr. Whitman, the director of e-operations, said he was testing new programs that might address some of the problems of online distraction. A system that takes the locations of students into account could be used to set rules that varied from place to place. Any use of the Internet might be acceptable in the library or the dean's office, he said, ""but if you're downstairs in Jay's classroom, you could not surf the Internet or you could surf the Internet but only go to CNN.com for in-class reading.""  Joseph Sun, a first year M.B.A. student in Professor Mallek's class, takes notes with pen and paper. He owns a laptop but does not take it to class. Although it ""comes in handy to look up an article or quote during discussion,"" Mr. Sun said, he has to resist ""the temptation to surf the Net during lectures.""  Students say they are finding a balance in the classroom between the good uses of online technology and its temptations. Tetse Ukueberuwa, a major in environmental studies at Dartmouth, said, ""Over all, it's a great thing,"" being able to check e-mail messages and conduct online research anywhere on her campus. Ms. Ukueberuwa said she preferred to take notes by hand, however, saying: ""I feel I'm more in touch with what the teacher is saying. You're looking at the teacher instead of looking at your computer.""  As a junior, though, she realizes that she may be ""old-fashioned."" Every incoming class, she said, seems ""more technologically advanced"" than the last. http://www.nytimes.com Graphic   Photo: Prof. Jay Mallek and a student, Brian Betz, exchanging data on wireless laptops at American University.

2003-01-02,"Putnam man dies of gunshot",67,"WINFIELD - A Putnam County man apparently killed himself early Wednesday after police arrived at his Buff Creek home to investigate a domestic violence call. Hurricane police and Putnam County Sheriff deputies approached George Richardson on the porch of his home off of U.S. 34 at about 12:40 a.m. Richardson pointed his shotgun at an officer, fled into his house and shot himself in the head in the back bedroom, said Deputy Allen Savilla. One shot had already been fired when police arrived at the Richardson home, Savilla said. Richardson's wife called police on her cell phone after she left her house and fled into the woods with her two young children, Savilla said."
2003-01-02,"Rain can't steal Brigades' inner beauty;They perform solo after parade delay",68,"THE WEATHER outside was frightful but the Mummers inside were delightful. The Fancy Brigade Finale at the Pennsylvania Convention Center was the only show in town yesterday after rain washed out the Mummers Parade along Market Street. The outdoor parade is rescheduled for 9 a.m. Saturday. Brigades were judged, but the results sealed until after they have joined the strut along Market. The forecast is for clearing Saturday after two days of rain and snow, with highs in the upper 30s. WPHL-TV (Channel 17) will telecast the parade, including a tape of brigades from yesterday. Yesterday's shows drew bus tours, overnight visitors, cheering partisans of the 12 brigades and - for the first time - string- band members who normally are parading at the same time. The show was awesome. Fans squealed as Hall of Fame Captain Jim Julia, of the defending champ Downtowners, flipped out of a tomb as a pyramid rose to the roof in ""The Lost Civilization of Egypt."" The Jokers, three-time winners since 1998, spun ""Carnival of Animals"" with beach-ball-tossing monkeys, rump-shimmying horses, parrots on swings and pogo-jumping frogs. Shooting Stars, the winningest brigade ever, dazzled with dance in riotously colorful kilts in ""Land of the Clans."" Satin Slipper's robo-cops, the Vikings' dancing piles of junk and Golden Crown's lava-loving ""Phoenix"" also drew huge cheers. Dozens of string-bandsmen enjoyed the show after scrambling to get into the sold-out center on their suddenly strutless day. Some VIPs got courtesy tickets from brigade officials, who aren't always their best buddies in feuding Mummery. Rank-and-filers, who often maintain personal friendships with those in rival clubs or divisions, volunteered as marshals behind the scenes or scored the last box-office ducats. This was the sixth year for the brigades' Convention Center finale but the first time they've been solo. The last rainout was 1990, a lifetime ago when the entire parade was outdoors - on Broad Street. The finale was created in part to provide the city with a guaranteed New Year's Day attraction to market for hotel packages and bus tours - a successful plan that filled the noon (unjudged) show with out-of-towners. The Convention Center also provides a venue for the brigades' wheeled and machine-powered props, which had become unwieldy on the street. Those props aren't allowed under string-band rules. The bands, considered Mummery's major attraction, have insisted on staying outdoors. Yesterday raised the inevitable question about bands' joining the brigades indoors, but no bandsmen were signing on. ""What did you say? What did you say?"" said John Pignotti, String Band Association president, with a smile. He sat in the sixth row as a last-minute guest of Fancy Brigade Association President Tom Cloney. ""I'm not gonna touch that one,"" said Cloney. ""How 'bout them Eagles?"" feigned Ferko String Band official Anthony Celenza. He added, ""The brigades' concepts have always been totally different, a different style, with things not allowed under our rules."" Meryl Levitz, head of the Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation, took in the finale and said she'd love to have the string bands indoors to add to her marketing campaign. ""It would be wonderful to keep splitting up the parade,"" she said. ""It's just too long. There's no reason to do it all in one day."" With the Comic, Fancy, String Band and Brigade divisions, she added, ""It's four separate parades. Why not recognize that?"" Meanwhile, on Two Street, the Mummers' heartland, rains washed away any doubts about the 4 a.m. decision to postpone. Avalon String Band Chief Marshal Paul Kaiser supervised the unloading of joker and jester props from four rented trucks that must be returned - and re-rented for the weekend. Then he dialed his cell phone in search of a church or charity to accept donation of 500 sandwiches that Avalon chef (and saxophonist) A. J. Paesani had made for yesterday's usually hungry hordes. Musician Mike ""Myzo"" Myslin-ski endorsed the decision to postpone, but he was antsy. ""I had about three days' nervous energy built up, and now I'm not going to be able to release it until Saturday,"" he said. Up the block, Tom Malony, captain of the 673-marcher Froggy Carr Comic Wench Brigade, had called the North Philadelphia church musicians in Froggy's hired band at 5 a.m. and told them: Stay home. Jackie McCann Buggey, president of Hog Island and a Fancy Division director, said the meeting with city officials was a chat, not a vote, with all in quick agreement. ""We looked at the maps and it was all green - all precipitation,"" she said."
2003-01-03,"RESEARCH SPENDING GOING UP;UD, Delphi among those with fattened budgets",69,"DAYTON - A tiny cell phone mounted in your wristwatch? Perhaps in five years, says the head of the University of Dayton Research Institute. Autopilot cars that do the vacation driving while you snooze? Scientists at Delphi Corp. are working on it. Computers that scan airport crowds for terrorists? The government is spending big bucks to make it happen. The Dick Tracy wristwatch and technology to combat terrorism are coming fast as university and corporate research departments pencil in fattened budgets for 2003. Total research expenditures in the United States this year are forecasted to rise 3.4 percent to nearly $302 billion, according to a joint survey by Battelle, a Columbus-based research firm, and R&D Magazine , a trade publication. Federal spending on research and development, including money for homeland defense, is estimated at $89 billion, a jump of 10.5 percent. Industrial spending on R&D in 2003 is forecasted to be virtually flat at $194 billion, up less than 1 percent. Nevertheless, corporate research continues to dwarf government-sponsored R&D. Universities and other nonprofit organizations are projected to spend more than $18 billion of their own funds on R&D, an increase of 7 percent over last year, according to the study. Battelle said two factors last year - the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the corporate accounting scandals - have deeply affected funding for scientific research. The misbehavior by some corporations has caused many companies to be overly cautious on funding for long-term research, noted Michael ""Mickey"" McCabe, director of the UD Research Institute. Companies are more focused on quick results, McCabe said. ""There is a real emphasis on, 'You better deliver what you say you can deliver tomorrow, or we're going to be in the newspaper.' There is a very clear environment like that in business today,"" McCabe said. The federal government is spending heavily on communications, intelligence, surveillance, smarter weaponry, better intelligence gathering and interpretation and improved responses to chemical and biological warfare, said Jules Duga, the Battelle survey's author and a senior research leader. ""Given the far-reaching impacts of some actions and events of the past two years, it is safe to say that we have witnessed a sea change in the manner in which all types of activities will be altered,"" Duga said. ""Although there are historic precedents that help us deal with some of the perturbations of the system, a 'return to normalcy' is not expected in the near term."" But one wild card - a war in Iraq or elsewhere - could quickly drain away government spending on non-military applications, cautioned UD's McCabe. He said the government will start shifting money from nonessential programs when armed conflict begins. ""Our biggest supplier of research money at the university comes from the Department of Defense,"" McCabe said. ""We are especially vulnerable."" If war is avoided, UD and its Research Institute are on track to have their best year for sponsored research. R&D for 2003 will top $50 million, up 8 percent from last year, McCabe said. At Wright State University, total corporate research for 2003 is estimated at $4.7 million, up from $3.7 million last year, said Bill Sellers, director of Research and Sponsored Programs. For example, he said the School of Medicine has a $75,000 contract to help develop a treatment for anemia in children. Auto-parts maker Delphi Corp. plans to spend 6 percent of sales, or about $1.8 billion, on research and advanced engineering this year, up from $1.6 billion in 2002. ""The company's focus is on electronics and electronically-enhanced components,"" said spokeswoman Kelly Sorice in Troy, Mich. Research includes work on devices that permit cruise control to slow a car if a vehicle ahead draws too close, sensors that awaken a driver if he starts to doze, and an autopilot that lets the car follow a magnetic strip in the road, Sorice said.

2003-01-03,"SADDLED STUDENTS LIGHTEN THE BACKPACKS SO KIDS CAN STAND TALL",70,"Incredibly heavy book bags are creating a generation of students who could be stooped and hunched over before they reach middle age.  Health-care professionals are increasingly concerned about the heavy loads many kids carry today in their backpacks. Some of these bags are so big, and packed with so many features, that a kid could almost camp in one. Some seem to try, toting textbooks, lunch, cell phones, electronic games and who knows what else to and from school and between classrooms. Of course, many of their parents and grandparents will dust off stories about how they walked five miles to school, in the snow, carrying books and supplies, long before there were backpacks. But there are valid reasons for public concern.  For one thing, textbooks really are heavier. The addition of graphics, charts and photographs, sometimes to comply with education reform mandates, has increased their weight. In addition, to counter the drug and gang cultures, some schools have done away with lockers to eliminate a place to hide weapons or drugs. That means the backpack must be lugged around all day.  A story in Sunday's Post-Gazette reported that one California school district plans to provide students two sets of books, a solution few districts can afford. California is also looking at a ban on overly heavy textbooks, but who's to say what's too heavy? There are other solutions. Schools can provide more access to lockers. They also can allow students more time to change classes, though the teachers unions might not support lengthening the school day. And in school districts where most or all children have access to computers, homework assignments can be placed online.  This isn't merely a matter of complaining students and overly protective parents, not with a growing number of students seeing doctors about back problems. This is a health issue."
2003-01-02,"Seoul Journal; The Power of Film: A Bond That Unites Koreans",71,"In real life, President Bush wrestles with policies to force North Korea to stop selling missiles and making atom bombs.   On the big screen, at movie theaters here today, James Bond wrestled with a crazed North Korean colonel who was using a space-based laser to burn a massive hole in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.   ""The U.S. put North Korea in 'the axis of evil' and then the director merely followed the plot,"" said Kim So Won, a 19-year-old student taking a break from a New Year's Eve anti-American rally.  As her girlfriends nodded, she added, ""We won't go see the movie.""  The new 007 movie, ""Die Another Day,"" opened here on New Year's Eve to a fledgling boycott. But reflecting the love-hate relationship with the United States -- the fact that James Bond is British is a fine point lost on many people here -- there were long lines of people waiting to see the film at the Seoul Theater.  Min Kyung Woo, a 28-year-old pacifist, lined up too, but on a picket line. ""This is Hollywood's strategy toward Northeast Asia,"" said Mr. Min, who had not been converted by a pre-release showing of the movie intended by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to head off a boycott here.  ""The movie industry is related to politics,"" he said.  Indeed, the boycott has been fueled by rising anti-American sentiment and the feeling among many here that North Koreans are replacing Colombians as Hollywood's current international bad guys. ""North Korean criminals in the movie are no different from Iraqi, Cuban or Russian terrorists, who easily commit mass murders in Hollywood action movies,"" the newspaper JoongAng Ilbo said in apparent surprise at the Bondian depiction of state-sponsored torture in North Korea, a nation that ranks high atop many ""worst"" lists compiled by international human rights groups.  While North and South Korea remain bitterly divided, judging by such reviews and those of some moviegoers here, the two sides have finally found common ground when confronting 007.  ""I think there is plenty for Koreans to complain about in this movie,"" Doug E. Shin, a Korean-American pastor from Los Angeles, said as he walked in a jostling, and largely merry, flood of young South Koreans leaving a showing tonight. ""Half the North Koreans were speaking with South Korean accents. That ox looked like it was from the Philippines. That shack at the end looked like it was from Japan.""  ""I guess the director didn't care,"" he continued. ""But if the movie was about Japan, would they have treated the Japanese that way?"" A recurring complaint here is about a final scene where befuddled Korean farmers, goading an ox, look at luxury cars that James Bond has dropped, upended, in a rice paddy. While North Korean agriculture plods along on ox power, South Koreans say the only ox carts seen here are in museums.  The correct image of South Korea, people say, is a nation with among the world's highest rates of cellphone ownership, high-speed Internet access and college-educated youth.  Then there is a scene where an American officer orders a South Korea military mobilization, which prompted someone to write in an Internet chat room that ""Korea in the movie is viewed as America's colony.""  After watching the movie today, Kim Yu Min, a 24-year-old office worker, said, ""My girlfriends said, 'At least James Bond doesn't go to bed with a Korean girl.' ""  MGM, which distributes 20th Century Fox movies, has worked hard to try to smooth ruffled feathers here, a nation of 43 million people that is now the 10th-largest foreign box office territory for American movies.  Lee Joo Sung, president of 20th Century Fox Korea, told opinion makers at one showing here: ""It's a movie. Not reality. Viewers must understand that it's fiction."" The movie, which stars Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry and is already expected to be the most lucrative Bond movie yet, ran into early controversy when a South Korean actor, Cha In Pyo, turned down the bad-guy role, normally a coveted ticket to Hollywood stardom. He became a local hero last fall when he told reporters that the script was ""demeaning.""  Rick Yune, the Korean-American actor who stars as the movie's crazed North Korean officer, has found himself at news conferences here parrying hostile questions from reporters concerned about South Korea's image. In one burst of patriotism, Lee Jung Hyun, a pop singer, declined an invitation to appear alongside Mr. Yune on a popular talk show, ""Happiness Channel."" North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency has obligingly given MGM free publicity by playing true to character.  Two weeks before the release here and well before pirated copies could have made their way to reviewers in North Korea, the news agency denounced the film as a ""dirty and cursed burlesque"" that clearly proved that the United States was ""the root cause of all disasters and misfortune of the Korean nation."" http://www.nytimes.com Graphic   Photos: Rick Yune, a Korean-American actor, plays a North Korean villain in the James Bond film ""Die Another Day,"" now showing in South Korea.

2003-01-01,"Slick roads foul travel for revelers;Icy conditions cause many accidents Tuesday, and snow is on the way.",72,"As yet more sleet and freezing rain coated southern Maine, stepping out on New Year's Eve proved difficult, and even dangerous. Travel conditions, poor throughout the day and early evening, were expected to worsen overnight, just as people were heading home from New Year's Eve parties. ""We're hoping that people won't be caught by surprise out there,"" said Kathy Beem, dispatch supervisor for the Maine State Police. ""Some people had a hard time in the morning."" Police throughout York and Cumberland counties reported numerous accidents Tuesday, most of them minor, caused by icy streets and sidewalks that made even routine maneuvers difficult. For several hours in the morning, Gorham police were scrambling from one accident to another along Route 22. In all, about a dozen cars went off the road there before 10 a.m. In one accident, a 36-foot-long box truck carrying lumber supplies collided with a Pontiac Grand Prix. Remarkably, the drivers of both vehicles escaped serious injury, as did the 2-year-old girl strapped in a safety seat in the back of the car. ""Without that seat, the child would have been hurt,"" said Wayne Coffin, a Gorham police officer. ""She was strapped in nice and tight. It worked well."" During the afternoon and into the evening Tuesday, state police received more than 250 cell phone calls from drivers reporting cars off the road. None of the accidents proved to be serious. Shortly before 5 p.m., the driver of a tractor-trailer truck skidded on the ice and rolled over at Exit 9 of Interstate 295 in Falmouth. No one was injured and the truck was not badly damaged, police said. ""When the forecast calls for this stuff, it helps to remind people to drive cautiously,"" said Beem, the state police dispatcher. The treacherous conditions were the result of sleet, rain and freezing temperatures, an unfortunate combination that, according to the National Weather Service, was expected to continue through the night. ""We had just enough rain to be a pain Tuesday morning, enough to cause a lot of problems on the roads,"" said Eric Sinsabaugh, a meteorologist. ""In Portland, it was right around freezing all day, which kept things slippery."" Sinsabaugh expected another band of rain before midnight, adding a layer of ice to the already slick streets. There's a chance of snow late today and again Friday, he said. ""It's that time of year,"" Sinsabaugh said."
2003-01-01,"Smoke signals send the right message",73,"CELLPHONE text messaging is helping young people to quit smoking, Auckland University researchers say. The researchers are conducting a study in which people who want to quit are sent motivational messages or paired up with other quitting smokers for support. Auckland University clinical trials research unit member Anthony Rodgers said 1300 people were now enrolled in the study, which began in August. He said the study was aimed at people between 18 and 35 years who had the highest smoking rate but the lowest uptake of cessation programmes. Dr Rodgers said participants received one month's free text messaging. They could pull personalised messages to distract them or bolster their resolve when they felt like lighting up. He said one popular feature was ""quit buddy"", which paired up participants for support. He said many participants had requested a buddy of the opposite sex. Dr Rodgers said it was too early for a scientific analysis of the study, but the feedback was encouraging."
2003-01-02,"SOLDIER WANTS ARMY TO PAY AS PROMISED;SHE SEEKS CHECKS FOR DRILLS, BONUS",74,"Christina Scypion enlisted in the Army to make her young son proud and to join the fight against terrorism. The rigors of basic training at Fort Jackson, S.C., did not deter the 5-foot, 98-pound woman, even though she suffered painful stress fractures of her right foot and right hip two weeks before graduating. ""Everybody told me, 'You're not going to make it,' "" she said. ""I threw my crutches away and I did it,"" including marching 14 miles with a 60-pound pack and a 7.5-pound M-16 rifle during a field exercise. Five months later, the 19-year-old private is using the same steely resolve to do battle with the Army itself. She said she hasn't received her enlistment bonus or two paychecks for weekend drills, a total of about $1,800. ""Maybe to a lot of people that's not a lot of money,"" she said. Her home phone has been disconnected, her cell-phone service canceled, and ""my 15-month-old son did not have any gifts from his parents"" for Christmas because she has not been paid, Scypion said. ""If people thought this kind of thing was happening, who would sign up and fight for the country?"" she said during an interview at her parents' home in Woodbridge. The Army Reserve Command said her paychecks for October and November drills were deposited directly into her bank account in December but that the paperwork for her $1,500 enlistment bonus was lost. Scypion said the paychecks were sent to the wrong bank, one she had specified before going to basic training. She said she canceled the first account and delivered a direct-deposit slip for her new account to her reserve unit at Fort Belvoir on Nov. 26, specifying the bank to which her checks should be sent. Army Reserve spokesman Joe Hanley said Tuesday that delays are not unusual in receiving a government check. ""Everybody in the government gets paid on a deferred basis. She came into the unit in October, and she got paid in mid-December. I was kind of surprised they paid her that quickly,"" he said. ""That's ridiculous because if that was the case, everybody there would be complaining about not being paid,"" said Scypion, a member of the 9th Theater Support Command. ""There were people who checked in at the same time [mid-October] as me, and they got paid in October."" Hanley said the paperwork for her enlistment bonus was submitted Nov. 1, ""and no one can seem to find it."" He said she should receive the money within two weeks. ""Financial things are slow now because we are in the process of mobilizing"" thousands of troops for a possible war against Iraq, he said. Under the enlistment contract she signed with the Army, Scypion is to receive a $3,000 bonus, half of which was to be paid after she completed advanced training Oct. 4. The remainder will be paid after the second and fourth years of her eight-year service commitment. Scypion said she always wanted to be a soldier, even as a little girl, and that the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, persuaded her to enlist. She also wanted her son to have a soldier mom. ""I wanted him to say, 'My mom is in the Army, and she fights for our country.' "" Scypion, who plans to start college in February and is looking for a civilian job, said she is proud to be an Army cook. ""The job I have . . . is one of the most important jobs. Without food and water, nobody could fight."" Leaving her son with her husband, Scypion left for boot camp May 20 and completed basic training July 25 as a member of B Company, 2nd Battalion, 13th Infantry Regiment, 1st Basic Combat Training Brigade. Immediately after basic, she started training as a cook at the Army Quartermaster School at Fort Lee, completing the course Oct. 4. She said she had no trouble getting paychecks while in basic and advanced training. It was only after she left active duty and was assigned to her Army Reserve unit that the problems started. ""I called on a repeated and daily basis and was reprimanded on a number of occasions for jumping the chain of command and becoming upset when I was not getting paid,"" she said. Said Hanley: ""Any soldier who reports for duty and performs with her unit deserves to be paid."" Graphic   PHOTO"
2003-01-02,"Spies keep busy as ever, quietly",75,"Following Russia's historic rapprochement with the West after Sept. 11, even celluloid superspy James Bond has forgiven his traditional nemesis in Moscow and gone in search of fresh enemies. The latest Bond flick, ""Die Another Day,"" has the evergreen hero battling bad guys from the hermit state of North Korea. That's fiction, but in the real world, actual spies appear to be busier than ever. In the past month alone, Canada and Sweden angrily expelled Russian diplomats for ""activities incompatible with their status,"" the familiar code for espionage. Moscow announced Friday that it will no longer accept US Peace Corps workers, after denying visas to 30 of 64 volunteers, charging they were up to more than humanitarian work. ""The leading intelligence agencies of the world have strengthened their presence in Russia,"" complained Oleg Firomolotov, deputy chief of counterintelligence for the FSB security service, in a recent interview with with the government paper Rossiskaya Gazeta. ""Russia is a priority object of their activity."" From the other side, the authoritative Jane's Intelligence Digest warns that ""Russian intelligence operations in the West appear to be rapidly escalating."" In London alone, the number of operatives of Moscow's SVR external spy service has jumped from just one in 1991 to 33 today, the journal estimates. Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks by moving Russia into solid geopolitical alignment with the West. In the past year, Russian and US special services have cooperated closely in the war against terrorism, and Moscow has even forged an historic friendship pact with the Western military alliance NATO. Experts say Mr. Putin's gestures were genuine, and that the Kremlin sees cooperation with the West as crucial, to overcome Russia's post-Soviet economic malaise and national identity crisis. ""In the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, Russia provided more help to the United States than all the countries of NATO combined,"" says Vyacheslav Nikonov, head of the independent Politika Foundation, and a former political adviser to the Soviet KGB security service. ""We have a common enemy now, and such contacts are very much in the interests of both sides."" In the short term, however, Russia's political shift has not brought the hoped-for wave of foreign investment to revive its sluggish economy, particularly the crumbling military-industrial complex. One traditional solution, with which former KGB foreign agent Putin is personally familiar, is to ferret out Western technological and managerial secrets by means of espionage. ""Intelligence services will always exist,"" says former KGB operative Stanislav Lekarev. ""It's a mistake to associate espionage with war. In fact, the less shooting is going on, the more spying there will be. Russia's secret services were much depleted in the post-Soviet era, so they're only now beginning to get back up to speed."" Two Russian diplomats expelled from Canada recently were reportedly agents of the GRU armed forces intelligence wing, seeking access to high-tech military secrets. Two Russians kicked out of Sweden in November were allegedly trying to penetrate Telefon AB LM Ericson, a company that makes cellphones and aircraft radar systems. Both cases resulted in old-fashioned tit-for-tat expulsions of Canadian and Swedish diplomats from Moscow. The thirty American Peace Corps workers barred from Russia last month stand accused of ""collecting information on the social, political, and economic situation in Russian regions, [on] staff members of bodies of power, [and] on elections,"" according to FSB director Nikolai Patrushev. Russian security officials are understandably tight-lipped about their espionage abroad, but often publicly express pride in their Soviet heritage, which includes running a formidable spy network in the West. In a recent Rossiskaya Gazeta interview, the head of Russia's SVR external intelligence agency, Sergei Lebedev, suggested that tradition may not have died with the USSR. ""Even now, many of our supporters help us out of political conviction,"" he said. ""There are people abroad who sympathize with Russia and support our efforts to build a multipolar world, to ensure a global balance of forces."" Experts say the international spy game now seldom leads to splashy public scandals the way it did in cold war days. Today, leaders dance a careful two-step around their countries' shadow activities. ""We've learned to spy and smile at the same time,"" says Mikhail Lyubimov, a famous Soviet agent who, since his retirement, has become one of Russia's best-loved writers of espionage novels. ""Our presidents go on kissing each other, and have become very adept at pretending nothing is happening."" Mr. Lebedev, the SVR chief, also hinted that what the public sees of today's cloak-and-dagger world is just the tip of the iceberg. ""I can tell you there are plenty of cases in which a spy is unmasked, and he is allowed by mutual agreement to leave the country quietly,"" he said. ""Neither the press nor anyone else ever gets to hear about it."" But the continuing focus of Russian security services on catching spies, and the broad definitions of the term they seem to apply, has some experts and human rights advocates worried. ""All reforms are coming to an end and we are returning to the past,"" says Konstantin Preobrazhensky, a former KGB colonel turned critic. ""The same bitter and vengeful people are in charge, and they feel their chance to return has arrived."" ""We see a lot of dubious accusations against journalists, environmentalists, human rights workers and scientists,"" says Otto Latsis, with the liberal daily Novoye Izvestiya. ""This has nothing to do with ensuring national security, and a lot to do with intimidating people who commit themselves to political causes that are inconvenient for the state, or who associate too much with foreigners."" In October, the FSB raided the offices of Baikal Ecological Wave, a coalition dedicated to saving Siberia's fragile Lake Baikal, seizing maps, volunteer lists, and computers. Then, this month, the commander of Russia's north Caucasus military zone, Viktor Kazantsev, accused humanitarian agencies of supplying food to Chechen rebels. ""All this aid activity should be taken under tough control,"" he said. ""We all know perfectly well who works in the Red Cross: spies."" Some argue Russia's security services are using harsh domestic tactics in a misguided effort to prove their relevance to a population weary of old enemy stereotypes. ""Our secret agents are the last children of the cold war,"" says Yury Shchekochikhin, deputy chairman of the State Duma's security commission. ""Of course the state must protect its secrets. But it's time for our special services to grow up and stop trying to divide the world into black and white, them and us. That time is gone forever."" (c) Copyright 2002.

2003-01-02,"Sports sponsorship appears to be on endurance run",76,"With business trends, nothing just keeps going up. Except maybe in sports, where values of sponsorships, TV revenue, player salaries, ticket prices and franchise sales generally have headed north for so many years they should be bogged down in frozen tundra. But in its annual forecast, consulting firm IEG projects sponsors will spend $ 7.21 billion in North America -- with at least 90% of that in the USA -- to buy official tie-ins to sports. That's an 11.2% jump over 2002. Says IEG's Jim Andrews, ""We're really surprised."" Surprising not just because that spending hike comes amid a sluggish economy. That 11.2% increase also exceeds projected 2003 hikes in overall U.S. ad spending as well as a projected hike in spending on non-sports sponsorships. And it dwarfs the 3.7% increase in total sponsor spending in 2002. The 11.2% hike also is surprising, Andrews says, because he'd expected the post-9/11 era to nudge sponsor spending away from sports and toward feel-good grass-roots events. Instead, sports are projected to slightly increase its share of total 2003 sponsor spending to 69%. For perspective, consider that sports sponsors' spending total is closing in on the gross domestic product of Namibia. The CIA's World Factbook lists that African nation's GDP at $ 8.1 billion. But big-time sponsors such as Pepsico, which IEG ranks as the top 2002 U.S. sponsor since it spent more than $ 235 million to buy its sports tie-ins, can sometimes spend three times as much promoting their official sponsorship status as they paid to get that official status. So to get a more accurate picture of sponsor spending, think Azerbaijan with its $ 24.3 billion GDP. The sports business has its brush fires, such as the odd franchise in trouble or the various college bowl games being staged although they interest almost nobody. But, as Andrews puts it, ""the sports machine just keeps humming."" Go, Army: U.S. Army Col. Thomas Nickerson expects about 2,000 leads from the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, a high school all-star football game in San Antonio airing Sunday on ESPN2. Last year's game, the first with Army sponsorship, produced 80 recruits. But the big picture, Nickerson says, is the exposure. The game, with plenty of Army logos around, will be held in ""a very branded venue."" The Army spends up to $ 24 million on sports marketing annually, this year introducing a Winston Cup NASCAR team. Nickerson says flexibility is key: ""When you have to recruit more than 100,000 people every year, you can't just keep doing the same things."" Spice rack: Sometimes, Olympic scandals bordering on the comical generate concerned headlines. But espn.com's Blood on the Rings series chronicles a real Olympic horror show.

2003-01-02,"Starting point Staff at CLC's new Women's Center seek tomake path easier for others",77,"From a feminist discussion group to a resource area featuring items on gender myths, the College of Lake County Women's Center offers many resources to female and male students, faculty and those off campus.  Employee Georgette Miller said the center also offers counseling, but she hopes people will forget the stereotype that it is only for women in crisis.  ""The center focuses on the woman as a whole, including academics, health and arts,"" she said.  The CLC women's center was started by Teresa Aguinaldo, a member of the communication arts faculty. She first discovered a women's center when she pursued her undergraduate degree at the University of Missouri at Columbia. It offered her solace while she was going through a divorce and raising a child.  ""Talking about the issues, I felt safe so I could go on with my schooling,"" she said.  As a faculty member at CLC, Aguinaldo, 36, saw students facing similar challenges and wanted to help them.  The women's center, which opened in September, targets special populations such as returning students, single mothers and victims of sexual assault.  ""The women's center is the nucleus. You come here and we can guide you,"" Aguinaldo said.  To run the center, Aguinaldo receives support from aides Kymm Dorward and Mary Hudson as well as a group of 30 volunteers.  Dorward, 46, who took her first class in 1990 at Texas Woman's University and earned 97 credits, said she couldn't afford to return to school after a divorce. Now living in Island Lake and receiving financial help, she is taking her first full semester at CLC.  Doward grew up on the West Coast where women's centers are common. She also worked at one in Texas, so she was surprised there was no center when she came to CLC. After meeting Aguinaldo and hearing she was going to open a center, Dorward joined the effort.  ""So many women are coming back to academics after being out 10, 20, 30 years. How do they know where to start?"" she said. ""How do they find out about financial aid, child care?""  Among the volunteers who support the center are Candice Marquette of Round Lake Heights. Marquette, 33, said she wants to meet women who, like herself, are not afraid to go back to school. She returned to school two years ago and is majoring in sociology.  ""Women are afraid to fail. I say do it anyway,"" she said. ""I like to see strength in women, supporting one another.""  Miller, 36, said she wants to help other women complete their education. She took classes part time since she was 18 years old. With the support of counselors, she went back to school full time and earned an associate's degree at CLC.  Miller, who will receive her bachelor's degree at Roosevelt University in counseling Jan. 11 and plans to pursue a master's degree, said she wants to summarize information she collects working at the center to help others.  ""I can consolidate the checklist to save them time and money,"" Miller said.  The center is also open to men. Dorward recalled two men who came to seek help for a female friend regarding a personal crisis. Three men serve on the planning committee, and a feminist discussion group called Reclaiming Eve was started by a male philosophy teacher and his students. They can do research.  ""Men are a part of the women's center in many ways. We do not want to alienate them in any way,"" Aguinaldo said.  To offer support to students, Aguinaldo said the center uses staff with expertise in personal and crisis counseling and advocates from area women's organizations. It also refers students to county support services. The center also offers literature on local organizations.  In February, Aguinaldo said the center will plan a fair where the public can learn about community resources such as the YWCA, the Staben House and Lake County Council Against Sexual Assault.  The center also provides a variety of resources including magazines, journals, CDs and DVDs on topics such as women in business, gender myths, sexual harassment, relationships and women in literature. Aguinaldo said there is information on international issues related to women.  ""Another population the center is geared to is women in cultural transition, people coming to college who are new to the culture,"" she said.  The women's center often collaborates with CLC faculty and other groups to offer workshops. Among other programs, the women's center has hosted a fund-raiser for breast cancer research and a women's suffrage month program titled Founding Mothers of Illinois that notes female achievers in Illinois.  Aguinaldo said she is working with college groups to celebrate Women's History Month in March. Also, a gender conference is planned in April and a program on masculinity is planned for spring.  An advisory board, made up of students and administrators, discusses how to add programs and resources. Aguinaldo adds she often receives calls from students and instructors who want to discuss future programs.  Aguinaldo hopes to create a women's publication and open a Web site next semester to feature information on the women's center and local, national and international news pertaining to women. Miller added they also hope to organize a support group for returning female students.  Dorward added she is working to start a campus watch group. Future goals may be offering self-defense classes and collecting cell phones for emergency use.  ""We are fortunate that crime is low at CLC but as the population grows, the risk of crime can increase,"" Aguinaldo said. ""It is part of the big picture, women being aware.""  Aguinaldo said services are limited. The center operates from a one-person office and has no budget its first year. Eventually she wants to bring classes inside the women's center.  Miller added the Grayslake community has been helpful. Businesses have donated food to support public programs.  While the response has been positive, Aguinaldo said some have asked why the college needs a women's center. Someone asked why there is no men's center.  ""We should have a men's center. I hope someone starts one. There are issues particular to men. They need their place, too,"" she said.

2003-01-03,"Stranded paraplegic did right things to stay alive, expert says",78,"REGINA -- Although Michael Brady was unprepared for winter travel, the 40-year-old paraplegic stranded on a snow-blocked rural road for more than 40 hours proved resourceful, says Saskatchewan Safety Council spokesperson Patrick Kurtz. ""He was very lucky, but he did do the right thing by staying with his vehicle and putting on extra clothing."" Travelling alone Sunday night, Brady was en route to Regina from a friend's farm near Hodgeville when he missed his turn and his vehicle left the road. Saskatchewan News Network; Regina Leader-Post He stayed in his van until Tuesday afternoon -- a bright and unseasonably warm day. He didn't know when he'd be found and was worried his fuel wouldn't last another night so he decided to look for help. He unloaded his wheelchair from his van and began a torturous trek on a snow-packed rural road. His ordeal ended when an area farmer found him and took him to a nearby farmhouse. According to the safety council, many travellers experience vehicle trouble at some point. ""The first thing you want to do is make sure you have good winter clothing for everybody -- jackets, gloves, boots, and toques and it's always a good idea to have a winter survival kit,"" Kurtz said. The kit should include a 48-hour candle, matches, a can-opener, freeze-dried food, and a first-aid kit. Booster cables, flashlights, tow rope, jack, flares and maps are also important to pack as well as shovels, traction mats and kitty litter for traction if you get stuck. ""Another really good idea is to carry a cellphone,"" Kurtz said. Brady cuddled his two dogs for warmth, ran the van every two hours for 15 minutes and covered his head with an extra sweater and boxer shorts to conserve body heat. ""My Dad taught me how to take care of yourself when you're in trouble,"" Brady said Wednesday. ""I just bought this van and I just didn't have the stuff I needed to be on the road."" Running your motor periodically in short intervals is a good idea, Kurtz said. ""But you want to make sure your tailpipe is clear so you don't have a build-up of carbon monoxide,"" he said. ""Make sure you keep the windows open a crack so you have some fresh air coming in."" It's also important not to do a lot of heavy exercise, he said. ""If you're perspiring, it tends to cool you down,"" Kurtz said. ""It depends on your circumstance, but we recommend that you don't do a lot of heavy shovelling. Take a look in your vehicle for things that can help you to survive -- like mats. Brady showed presence of mind by trying to use floor mats for traction, Kurtz said. ""If you have flares or reflectors, do put them out to let people know you are there and it's a really good idea if you're going to be travelling on the highway to let people know when you're leaving, what time you plan to arrive and the highway you're planning to travel on. If people are looking for you, it narrows down their search area."" Graphic   Photo: Canadian Press; Michael Brady at his Regina home with his dogs"
2003-01-02,"Summer Reading: The downfall of King Cocaine",79,"Mark Bowden: Killing Pablo Atlantic Monthy $23.95 The bizarre photograph shows a group of soldiers toting machineguns and grinning cheerfully - like hunters with a prize deer - by the body of a man lying twisted on the tiles of a roof. Hard to believe that their ""game"" was once one of the richest men in the world and one of the most powerful in Colombia. Journalist Mark Bowden first saw the photo framed on the wall of a United States military source. ""What's that?"" he asked. ""That, my friend, is Pablo Escobar,"" the military man said. ""I keep that on my wall to remind me that no matter how rich you get in life, you can still be too big for your britches."" Bowden, author of Black Hawk Down and a journalist with the Philadelphia Inquirer, had until then been unaware of the extent of US military involvement in the hunt for Escobar, who had run a ruthless terror campaign alongside his billion-dollar cocaine cartel while a fugitive from Colombian authorities. The photograph sparked his interest and he began researching a series of newspaper articles which would eventually become the book Killing Pablo. The bulk of the book rests upon interviews Bowden conducted with Americans and Colombians involved in the pursuit of Escobar from 1989 until his death on December 2, 1993. He was also able to obtain more than 1000 pages of mostly secret cables sent from the US Embassy in the Colombian capital, Bogota, to Washington. The documents amount to a daily record of the manhunt through the eyes of the Americans who took part. The book is a portrait of perhaps the most notorious criminal of modern times, as well as a fascinating insight into how the US operates on foreign soil. Pablo Escobar, from the northern Colombian city of Medellin, was born in 1949 and by the early 80s was a billionaire, controlling the notorious Medellin cartel that flooded the US with cocaine. In 1989, Forbes magazine listed him as the seventh-richest man in the world. Escobar killed anyone who crossed him, including hundreds of judges, police officers and politicians - and became one of the world's most feared terrorists. But, Bowden writes, while he was a vicious thug, he had a social conscience, having set up a group called Medellin Without Slums which helped to house the poor. He was a brutal crime boss but also a politician with a winning personal style that, at least for some, transcended the ugliness of his deeds. At his death, he was mourned by thousands. Crowds rioted when his casket was carried into the streets of Medellin. At his height, Escobar built small, remote-controlled submarines that could carry up to 2000kg of cocaine from the northern coast of Colombia to waters just off Puerto Rico, where divers would remove the shipment and transport it to Miami in speedboats. He would send fleets of planes north, each carrying 1000kg of cocaine. Eventually he was buying Boeing 727s, stripping out the seats, and loading as much as 10,000kg a flight. Customs intercepted only a fraction of the shipments. Escobar was above the law, and in Medellin he created a dual system of justice. The violence committed in the course of his business - the murder rate doubled in the city during this period - was ignored by the police. Escobar regarded murders committed by his hit-men, or sicarios, as matters of no consequence to society at large. It was strictly business, a grim necessity in a state without a strong legal system. He considered it his right to use violence on his own account, and on occasion did so publicly, binding a worker he had caught stealing from his estate hand and foot and personally kicking him into his swimming pool in front of horrified guests. By the early 80s, much of the ruling class in Bogota had made its peace with drug trafficking. Some saw cocaine simply as a new industry, one that had created a wealthy, young social class. The narcos, as the cocaine bosses were called, wanted the state to legitimise their enterprise, and given the money they were ready to spread around and the building boom going on in Medellin, some intellectuals saw the cocaine trade as potential economic salvation for Andean nations. Bowden says Escobar could have continued pulling strings in Colombian politics through a long lifetime, but the mistake he made was to covet a public role - hedecided to enter politics himself. In 1978 he was elected as a substitute city council member in Medellin. In 1982 he successfully ran for Congress, again standing as a substitute. The post carried automatic judicial immunity, so he could no longer be prosecuted for crimes under Colombian law. He was also entitled to a diplomatic visa, which he began using to make trips to the US with his family. Escobar told his friends he intended some day soon to be President. But his brush with politics was short-lived, and he retired from public service in 1984, when political rivals revealed his link to drug trafficking and his previous criminal convictions. Around this time the US began moving against cocaine billionaires. President Ronald Reagan created a Cabinet-level taskforce to co-ordinate efforts against drug-smuggling, with Vice-President George Bush in charge. The drug lords would become not just law enforcement targets but military ones - an important distinction. In 1986 Reagan signed a national security directive which for the first time declared drug trafficking a threat to national security, opening the door to direct military involvement in the war on drugs. At the same time, mainstream attitudes towards cocaine use underwent a dramatic shift. In June 1986, basketball star Len Bias collapsed and died after snorting cocaine. The decade-long flirtation with the white powder by affluent young Americans had begun to sour anyway, but Bias' death sealed it. Colombia had signed a treaty that recognised the shipment of illegal drugs to be a crime against the US. As such, it called for suspected drug traffickers to be extradited for trial to the US. The prospect struck fear into the hearts of men like Escobar, who declared ""better a tomb in Colombia than a prison cell in the United States"". So Escobar effectively went to ground in his hometown of Medellin, moving between safe houses and protected by crooked police and officials. He continued to run the Medellin cartel and carried out a series of murders, assassinations, kidnappings and bombings that kept Colombia in a constant state of seige. No one was immune from his wrath, and victims included the Justice Minister and a front-running presidential candidate. In 1989 the Colombian Government set up a special search team to hunt down Escobar and other cocaine kingpins. Colonel Hugo Martinez was appointed its commander, a post considered one of the most dangerous in Colombia. In the first 15 days, 30 of the colonel's 200 men were killed. Escobar's army of hitmen picked them off one by one. But Martinez bravely stuck to the task, and would be there four years later when Escobar was finally killed. At the same time that the search team was being set up, a secret US Army unit specialising in electronic surveillance was sent to Colombia to help to track down Escobar. Codenamed Centra Spike, the unit's speciality was finding people. Eavesdropping on radio and telephone conversations from the air, its members were capable of pinpointing the origin of a radio or cellphone call with amazing accuracy within seconds. The unit began tracking Escobar using a small aircraft stacked with millions of dollars of electronic gear. Each time Escobar phoned or radioed a friend or family member, the unit would track the call and the search team would be dispatched to take him out. But, incredibly, Escobar was able to avoid capture for years, despite having the US Army and its most sophisticated equipment on his tail. He did this through talking in code on the radio, tips from corrupt officials and bumbling by the search team. There was a brief reprieve for Colombia in 1991 when Escobar came to an agreement with the Government which led to him being imprisoned in a ""jail"" of his own making. It was in fact a mansion, and the guards were on his payroll. He was able to come and go as he pleased and continued to run his cocaine operation. After a year, the Government decided to move him to a proper jail, but when troops were sent to get him, he escaped and went back into hiding for the last year of his life. The pressure on Escobar became intense during this period. Rival cocaine cartel members and families of his victims formed a vigilante group called Los Pepes, which systematically went about murdering Escobar's associates and members of his extended family until he became isolated. Los Pepes boasted that they killed up to 300 people. Crucially, they were fed information by the search team, which was closely aligned with Centra Spike, raising the likelihood that the US was involved in the murders of Colombian civilians. In the end it was a combination of hard work by the search team and sheer blind luck which caught Escobar. The team had been listening in to his coded radio conversations with his son for several days. Colonel Martinez's son, a member of the search team who was a radio expert, was tracking the signal in a Medellin suburb when he suddenly saw Escobar standing at a window. Dozens of team members surrounded the house, and Escobar was shot after climbing out a window on to a roof. It appeared he may have been shot in the leg first, then executed at close range - a bullet had entered at the centre of his right ear and exited just in front of the left ear, passing straight through his brain. Hundreds of millions was spent on the hunt for Escobar, but his death did not stop the flow of drugs to the US. Rival cocaine cartels simply took over the business. But the killing was a major coup for the authorities who had hunted him for so long and brought to an end a terror campaign of incredible savagery: 30 judges killed, 457 policemen, 20 murders a day for two months. Finally Colombia could move out from Escobar's dark shadow. No wonder the soldiers in that photo could not suppress wide grins."
2003-01-01,"THE GO-TO GUY?;   WITH TOP RECEIVER DONALD DRIVER HURTING FOR SATURDAY'S GAME, TERRY GLENN COULD GET A CHANCE TO PUT UP BIG NUMBERS FOR THE PACKERS.",80,"This will be Terry Glenn's big chance to have the kind of impact he wanted to have this season. If wide receiver Donald Driver doesn't play in the Green Bay Packers' NFC first-round playoff game vs. Atlanta Saturday night -- and judging from how gingerly the Packers' leading receiver was pulling his sweatshirt over his head Tuesday, that's a real possibility -- it will be up to Glenn to make up for the loss. ""The guy that I believe will step up and take over there is Terry Glenn,"" said offensive coordinator Tom Rossley, who is preparing for the game under the premise that Driver will not be available. ""Terry's a guy that has to step up and be the playmaker."" Driver, who strained and bruised his right shoulder early in the second quarter of the Packers' 42-17 loss Sunday to the New York Jets, will be listed as questionable when the team's injury report is released today, coach Mike Sherman said. If Driver can't play, Robert Ferguson would start in Driver's place at split end and Javon Walker would move up to the No. 3 spot, while Glenn would become the obvious choice as the go-to receiver. Glenn had five catches for 76 yards and a touchdown vs. the Jets after Driver departed. Even if Driver, who caught 70 passes for 1,064 yards and nine touchdowns during the regular season, is able to play, the Packers will likely need a big performance from Glenn. The seventh-year veteran had just one 100-yard game this season - an eight-catch, 154-yard effort vs. Chicago Oct. 7 - after having 13 in 68 games with the New England Patriots. Glenn, 5-foot-11 and 195 pounds, finished the regular season with 56 receptions for 817 yards and two touchdowns in 15 games - numbers that marked the lowest output of his career for seasons in which he played in at least 14 games. He declined to speak with a reporter after the game Sunday, and he was not in the locker room during the designated media availability period Tuesday. Glenn didn't return a message left on his cell phone Tuesday night. ""I'm sure from Terry's standpoint, and I'm guessing, that he would like to be more involved,"" Packers quarterback Brett Favre said Tuesday. ""For the most part, when I've thrown it to him, he's caught it. We just haven't thrown it to him that much. ""He makes two great catches against Chicago, and I'm sure from his standpoint, it's like, 'Hey, I can do that. Keep throwing it.' He made some great plays the other day (against the Jets). We needed a lot more of those, and not just from him. When you get that opportunity, you have to make the most of it. And I think he realizes that. And he's up to the challenge."" Rossley said the Packers wouldn't necessarily alter their game plan if Driver didn't play. ""I think there will probably be a little more focus to Terry if Donald isn't out there,"" Rossley said. ""It doesn't say that he'll catch more balls. (Maybe) Walker will or Ferguson will or maybe Karsten (Bailey, the No. 4 receiver). We're still running the offense, (but) how they match up defensively and how they play us in man coverage could have an effect on how we call things."" According to Sherman, Glenn ""has and will continue to be a big part of our offense. Obviously without Donald in there, Terry is the lone experienced player. So Terry will be relied on for his experience."" The Packers have averaged 18.3 points per game the past four games and have struggled to make big plays. Glenn caught three of the Packers' seven pass plays of 40 yards or more this season: a 42-yarder vs. Atlanta Sept. 8; a 49-yarder vs. the Bears Oct. 7; and a 46-yarder vs. Detroit Nov. 1. Green Bay has had just one such play in the past month (a 40-yard touchdown catch by Ferguson vs. Minnesota Dec. 8). ""I don't know what's going to happen with Donald, whether or not he's going to play,"" Favre said. ""Either way, Terry has to think that he's going to have a big game. And I'll sling it to him, it doesn't matter. I think he's up for the challenge.""

2003-01-03,"THEATRICS WE CAN DO WITHOUT",81,"Whenever you do something with any regularity, there are little things that start to bother you. I love going to the theater, but I admit there are a few things that get under my skin. Here are the Top 10. 1. The call of the rude. Everybody hates cell phones when somebody else is talking on them. When a phone rings in the theater, there's nothing more intrusive. Recently, a woman behind me answered her phone and carried on a whispered conversation with the caller. Even worse is the person who refuses to admit guilt by answering and so just lets it ring.  2. The strip tease. OK, sometimes you gotta have a mint. But that slow crinkling is unbearable. Do it like a Band-Aid, guys. One big rip and it's off. Better yet, go with Lifesavers, almost no noise. But leave the Tic-Tacs at home.  3. Money makes the world go round. The theater world, anyway. Some of the smaller companies have started pleading for donations before every performance. I'm certainly sympathetic to the cause but would prefer an insert in the program. Your audience has just forked over some hard-earned cash. Show them how much you deserve it before you hit them up for more.  4. What light through yonder window breaks. Unrealistic lighting effects in an otherwise realistic production. Hate 'em.  5. If Kurt Cobain met Hedda Gabler. I cringe when lyrics of background or scene-setting music are supposed to comment on the subtext of a production. Besides, if the audience is listening to those lyrics, you've already got problems.  6. If at first you don't succeed. There is no ""take two"" in theater. Starting a line over is just a big, flashing, neon ""mistake"" sign.  7. Help unemployed dramaturgs. Put an end to mispronunciations on stage.  8. Laugh and the world wonders why. This one's pretty much limited to college productions -- supportive friends who hoot and holler stupidly every time their pals set foot on stage.  9. Too little information. These are things that belong in the program -- the name of the person who translated the script, the name of the person who adapted the script, the name of the person who wrote the book on which the script is based.  10. Too much information. These are things that don't belong in the program (or, in the not-so-cute actor bio) -- inside jokes, silly dedications, lurid details about the bonds formed during rehearsals. Isn't the goal to attract an audience beyond the cast's immediate friends and family? Isn't the program supposed to be for the benefit of that audience?

People line up at his personal appearances for autographed glossy advertising flyers. He has also earned detractors: whole Web sites are dedicated to trashing him. ""The mute button on my remote is getting worn out from all the times I have to deal with him invading my television,"" one posting says, summing up the sentiments of many at a site called ""Billy Mays Mayhem."" Soft-spoken in conversation, Mays claims he just recently learned of this Internet presence and hasn't looked at the sites. ""I'm a sensitive guy,"" he said. ""I don't want to be brought down, so I just leave it at that. As long as there's good and bad, it evens itself out."" Mays has never been anything but a salesman, and developed his style demonstrating knives, mops and other ""as seen on TV"" goods on Atlantic City's boardwalk. For years he worked on the state-fair and home-show circuits. After meeting Orange Glo International founder Max Appel at a home show in the mid-1990s, Mays was recruited to demonstrate the environmentally friendly line of cleaning products on the Home Shopping Network (where he met his wife Deborah). Sales took off from the very first day he was on. Commercials and informercials followed, anchored by the high-energy Mays showing how it's done while tossing out memorable phrases like, ""Long live your laundry!"" Now he's the public face of a company projected to earn $330 million in 2002, up from $245 million in 2001. It's hard for cleaning products to stand out in a crowded market, and Mays moved Orange Glo out of the pack, says Karen Benezra, editor of advertising trade magazine Brandweek. ""What Billy has done with his products was give them the no-nonsense, 'Hey-I'm-a-regular-Joe' kind of face,"" Benezra says. ""He just gives you the sense you can believe him.""

2003-01-01,"Wave of the future",85,"Darren Westenhaver has some simple advice for boosting the excitement of PCs: get moving. Westenhaver, who heads Salt Lake-based Alden Media, recommends video -- full-blown moving pictures with accompanying sound -- as a way to get customers, employees or anyone else staring at a PC. The attraction is how it can mimic a television. ""That's really where the TV and the PC converge, is the ability for video to play on your PC, whether off a CD or DVD or the Internet,"" Westenhaver told a crowd at the recent Connect 2002 technology conference. Formerly involved in film and video editing and film production, Westenhaver runs a company that ""repurposes"" video for VHS tapes, DVDs, CDs and the Internet. In a simple demonstration at the conference, he used a PC to run video of a woman talking -- far more attention-getting than the static text she was reading on the other side of the monitor. The business applications are limitless, he said. ""You can't afford any longer to just think about broadcast,"" he said. ""If you do advertising and marketing, you have to think beyond the set-top box. You have to think about the Web, DVD and CD, because people's minds are no longer locked into TV."" Some PDAs, for example, allow the user to take and store photos and video. ""It's amazing the way the technology is converging,"" he said. ""This whole convergence of video onto the PC and Palm Pilot and cell phone is going to change the way marketing is done."" Video on cell phones is becoming more common in Japan, he said. ""You might think, why would I ever want to do that? If you're an advertiser, and you look at the Internet with those annoying pop-up ads, imagine if you have a cell phone and you have pop-ups."" Technology will allow a person to view a TV signal, and the closed-caption part of the screen will be able to provide access to e-mails to learn more about, say, a car or jeans on the video. Eventually it will allow people to order the items they see on the screen, he said. ""Imagine how that will affect the advertising market,"" he said. The interactivity offered by DVDs allows for training of employees to be more effective, he said. A DVD can be designed to contain training video but stop if the viewer is having trouble learning. ""If they make the wrong choice, you can have a video review, and you can set up the DVD on a PC so that it tracks the results of what they're experiencing, and you'll be able to see are they doing what they're supposed to be doing, following the instructions they've been given,"" Westenhaver said. One of his clients is an Oregon construction company that has developed technology for crushing rocks. It used to send out salespeople, armed to the teeth with TVs and lots of videotapes, to prospective customers. Now all the information is on a CD that includes DVD content, which the sales reps show on their laptops. Animation has helped the company with assembly logistics, too. ""They're able to take this video and build that piece of equipment with the video, step by step: Watch it, pause it, build it. Watch it, pause it, build it. They used to have to send out a consultant to go sit with the guy and help him build this huge piece of machinery, to be sure it ran well and safe, and now they just send out a CD."" Another DVD made by Alden Media was for a manufacturer of materials used in knee-replacement procedures. It uses animation to show how a knee is surgically replaced, interspersing that with video of a football player suffering the injury that led to the procedure. Animation files are prime candidates for use in courtrooms, he said. Graphics on posters can be replaced by animation shown on big-screen projectors. ""The applications for the courtroom are significant for injuries or anything like that, to show processes,"" Westenhaver said. ""There really is no limit to what you can do."" Text searches of dialogue on video also can allow a lawyer to easily and quickly find the video clip -- part of an arsenal an attorney can use to discredit a witness' contradictory testimony on the spot. Another option for the video-minded is QuickTime VR. It allows the PC user to get a 360-degree view of an image -- manipulating its motion and zooms by pressing certain keys on the keyboard. A new development is directional sound. Spin the image of a home's exterior this way to hear a babbling brook. Spin it the other way to hear birds. Virtual tours of homes -- big among real estate types -- also can feature a link that allows users to see options for, say, the types of kitchen countertops that are available and how much they cost. ""It enables you to do a lot of stuff with sales and marketing but also educating your clients. Before they even come into the house, they can literally take a tour and make a lot of decisions about your product."" A self-confessed video junkie for years -- remember album-sized laser discs? -- Westenhaver discovered he can use his PC to watch DVDs of the entire season of the TV show ""24"" and to access Web sites to learn more about the show's season. ""It's limited only by what you can imagine,"" he said of the video/PC convergence. ""You can do a lot of stuff with this."" E-mail: bwallace@desnews.com "

2003-01-02,"Winter terrorland",87,"For Michigan residents, this time of year is the scariest to be behind the wheel. It only takes these three tips of advice however to be safe -- slow down, pay attention and stay off your cell phone! If only we lived in Florida. Doesn't that cross the mind of countless Michigan residents every winter when our state (especially the West Michigan area) gets dumped on with tons and tons of snow? Sure, the snow might turn an otherwise brown and drabby landscape into a beautiful, glistening wonderland, which causes the ski resorts and snowmobiling enthusiasts to leap with joy, but at the same time, the snow causes some major disadvantages. The big gripe with Michigan residents is the pain-in-the-butt slippery roads and terrible driving conditions that reek havoc on our cars. Seeing countless cars resting in ditches during or after a blizzard is just about as common as seeing your waste line expand after eating so much during the holiday season. In both cases, it can be avoidable, and in both cases you need to be smart to prevent such a terrible thing to happen. (Or maybe you just need to stop eating Christmas cookies?) Grand Valley State U. According to the Michigan Department of Transportation, there are several driving tips one can use to help them avoid those lovely costs of a tow truck. Many of them are simply using common sense, such as keeping your cars windows, mirrors and lights clear of snow and ice, knowing the current road conditions and weather forecasts before you venture out onto the highways and reducing your speed. Other tips that one might not think about include leaving a few minutes early to allow extra time to get to your destination, starting out slowly in the lowest gear, which is also recommended by many auto manufacturers, be aware of potentially icy areas such as shady spots and bridges, keep a safe distance of at least five seconds behind other vehicles and trucks that are plowing the road, don't pass a snowplow or spreader unless it is absolutely necessary-treat them as you would an emergency response vehicle, don't park along a street because snowplow drivers cannot fully clear a road if cars are in their way and finally, keep an emergency winter driving kit in your car in case you are stranded in the freezing temperatures for long periods of time. Another tip that should be on there but isn't, is pay attention! So many times if you have complete focus on the road you can easily correct your car from sliding across the road or from avoiding another car that might be sliding toward yours. Too often drivers are distracted from other passengers in the car, from eating while driving or from the very stupid mistake of trying to talk on their cell phone while driving. In a study released by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, cell phones were responsible for about 6 percent of U.S. auto accidents each year, killing an estimated 2,600 people and injuring 330,000. Sure it is important to keep in contact with your loved ones during the winter break, but at least pull over to a rest area or gas station to talk. Driving during winter months simply requires too much of your attention to be also focusing on a conversation at the same time. While they definitely provide a hazard for driving during a winter, cell phones become a valuable commodity in case your car dies and your stranded on the side of the highway when its 5 degrees outside. So be smart when you're driving this winter! A little common sense can go a long way when you're behind the wheel. Your loved ones shouldn't mind that it took you a little longer to get to their place, just as long as you are safe. (C) 2002 The Lanthorn via U-WIRE"
2003-01-03,"Woman reports intruder to her son -- a policeman",88,"A Lampeter woman Thursday did what any policeman's mother would do when faced with a possible intruder: She called her son. The victim, whom West Lampeter Township police did not identify, was awakened by the sound of someone trying to break into her home around 5:30 a.m. Thursday. #COP.ELL.ANEng.j6# The woman called her son, an East Lampeter Township policeman, on his cell phone to tell him of her dilemma. Emergency dispatchers also notified police in the municipality where she lives. East Lampeter Township police Officer Sam Goss kept his mother on the line while he drove to her home, and he arrived shortly before two West Lampeter Township policemen. The suspect, identified as Matthew Plantholt, 24, of 211 E. Ross St., was still trying to get in the house when Goss arrived, police said. Goss identified himself as a police officer and ordered him to the ground, investigators said. But when Plantholt saw two more policemen arrive, West Lampeter Township police Officer Richard Buck said, the suspect starting running, ignoring commands to stop. As the suspect bolted across Lampeter Road, Buck said, West Lampeter Township police Officer Joseph Eisenhour tackled Plantholt. Police charged Plantholt with defiant trespass, loitering and prowling at night, resisting arrest and public drunkenness. Plantholt's explanation to investigators was that he at one time knew the Goss family and was looking for a place to go Thursday morning. He was arraigned before District Justice M.A. Hamilton and was committed to county prison in lieu of $3,000 bail."
2003-01-02,"Year in review: Nobody asked for this",89,"It's time warp time again. New Year's, time to plan ahead while looking back, which is a little like a belly-up swimmer doing a front crawl. It's time to move on, but first here is a look at where we've been. We revisit many athletes who appeared on the minor/amateur pages in 2002 and all have one thing in common: none of this chosen few asked for this. RECORD STAFF LESS IS MORE Which means we should begin with Louie Maier of Cambridge, 76-year-old bronze medalist in world masters cross-country skiing. No loose-lip Louie, Maier never asks for much. He has all he needs -- a home in Cambridge, a bicycle, a pair of skis and the fitness to put them to good use. ""Don't write too much,"" he pleaded, when a reporter called. To your health, Louie. LOCAL HAZARD Remember Matt Gray? Now, here's a kid who gives new meaning to the term, home run. When he was younger, it was no big deal to hit his dad's pitches in the front yard of their country home. Over the years as he hit the ball farther and farther, the nearby houses were within range and they moved to a ballyard in Mannheim where Matt bounced a low, hard one off his father's shin. Move on, Matt. Team Ontario beckons. Go there. NEW HEIGHTS Sarah Pavan, power hitter with the Waterloo Tigers juvenile volleyball team as well as the Forest Heights senior girls, is a top prospect for a U.S. college scholarship when she graduates. And why not? Good six-foot-four players just don't come along every day. Only thing he is, she may feel cramped for space when she leaves home. Parents Paul and Cindy are also six-foot-four and live in a house custom made for tall people. College is a couple years away, time enough for her to get used to the idea of a dorm quite unlike the 12-foot vaulted ceiling she has at home. BEEP BEEP Tracey Buckley took time away from her sales job at RIM to do an adventure race near Whitehorse. Hiking books, a mountain bike and a pair of canoes replaced cellphones and e-mails, the everyday things in the life of a techie. After two or three exhausting days in the woods, any of the hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo's they heard may have sounded high tech because she and her three teammates were hallucinating, Blair Witch Project style. FEAR OF LANDING A two-pronged skate blade here. Can anyone forget Nexxice and their chain reaction crash during the Skate Canada synchonized nationals last March at the Aud? The crash put them in fourth place, meaning they get just one international assignment instead of two in 2003. It was a bigger tragedy than, say, if they returned to the dressing room, only to find someone had raised all the toilet seats. But when K-W's Royales on Ice flew to Italy in February for the Milano Spring Cup, their skates were not carry-on. They had to pack them away and live with the possibility they might make a separate trip to some far-off Isle of Lost Luggage. GO FIGURE Olivia Skonieczka has it made. The 13-year-old K-W Skating Club member placed first overall at the Canada Winter Games trials after winning the Western Ontario Sectionals. Thing is, Olivia will always climb through the ranks of figure skaters with a song in her head. She listens to music so often at home that it would be no big trick for her to plan her routines all the way through senior. SWEET HOME ALABAMA Here is where it all leads: Kenen Shadd, the triple jumper who lives for the long jump, the triple jump and the avoidance of football, is heading for Alabama. He begins with some academic upgrading at a junior college, reports his mother, Ruth. Not bad for a kid who survived a football tackle from older brother Shaun, landed ""everywhere"" in his parents' living room, and followed up with career planning that steered him wide of the gridiron. WHO YA GONNA CALL? OK. Suppose you flat out on a mountain bike trail. Who is the person you should want to come along? Well, life couldn't get much better than if Cambridge's Karley Cunningham should appear with tire irons and a canister of carbon dioxide. While Karley rises through the ranks of women's pro elite mountain bikers, she is out to show that a woman can change a tire as quickly as a man. Let her flat out in a car, though, and she'll call for roadside assistance. Like anyone else, she wants to get what she pays for. robrien@therecord.com "
